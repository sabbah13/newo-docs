### Interactive walkthrough

This interactive guide walks through the multi-agent, multi-flow logic starting at the `conversation_started` event and the `ConversationStartedSkill` skill. Use the player below to follow the story with code highlights.

### Code entry points

We begin at the `conversation_started` event, which triggers the `ConversationStartedSkill` and related generation-specific skills.

### Narrative overview

- **ConversationStartedSkill**: Detects integration, sets follow-up timers, sends greeting or fast prompts, prepares RAG context, updates session and phone-number metadata, and starts a session timer.
- **Gen1/Gen2 Inbound/Outbound Skills**: Specialize greeting and fast prompt logic, set follow-up timers for inbound vs outbound, and call `CommonConversationStartedSkill` in steps.
- **SwitchConversationStartedSkill / SwitchReplyOutboundSkill**: Select which generation-specific skill to use based on `project_attributes_setting_voice_integration_service_voice_mode` and whether the reply is outbound.

See the Kodemo player for a step-by-step, code-highlighted run-through of these components.
