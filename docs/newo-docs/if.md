# If

An IF statement is a conditional construct used to execute specific blocks of code only when certain conditions are met. If the condition is evaluated as true, the code block inside the IF statement is executed. If the condition is evaluated as false, it is skipped, or an alternative code block is executed (usually specified in an ELSE clause).

The format of an IF and ELSE statement within the Newo.ai scripting language is as follows:

```
{{#if some_condition}}
    Code to execute if the condition is true
{{else}}
    Code to execute if the condition is false
{{/if}}
```
