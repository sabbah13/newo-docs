# Flow

The Flow is defined as the process the Intelligent Agent goes through when communicating with a user. Elements of each Flow include:

*   **Skills:** Represent the logic of an agent, where you explain what the agent should do.
*   **State:** A service that deals with storing and issuing parameters within a given Flow Instance. Through State, different Skills can exchange data.
*   **Agent Persona:** The identity of the Intelligent Agent. Each Flow must have only one Agent Persona.
*   **Flow Instance:** A set of objects in the Newo.ai platform that is responsible for the interaction of a specific Agent and User.
