# Retrieve Context from AKB

Time to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by shifting the context within our Skill Script to the Newo.ai Active Knowledge Base. Why? Two main reasons:

*   To save time.
*   To save money.

Most LLMs have limitations on the amount of information that can be fed to them. Therefore, you are limited by how much information you can add directly to the Skill Script. The more information sent to an LLM, the slower it gets to generate a response. This can also result in your Intelligent Agent failing to do their job, resulting in a loss of revenue for the company integrating the agent.

By moving context information to an external database, we can search, extract, and feed a small, relevant portion of the information contained within a larger information set to the LLM. This saves time and money.

**Goal:** Remove context information from the Skill Script and retrieve it from AKB.

Let's use the same agent setup as with the "[Embedded Instructions](embedded-instructions.md)" example. However, replace the Skill Script with the below:

```
{{#system~}}
{{set(name='agent_', value=GetAgent())}}
{{set(name='user_', value=GetUser())}}
{{set(name='memory', value=GetMemory(count=40, maxLen=20000))}}


BIOGRAPHY:
You are a call center Agent named {{agent_}} for the Hotel chain called “Katya's Resorts,” talking to User named {{user_}}. 


YOUR INSTRUCTION: 

Read the AGENT-USER CONVERSATION and think which instruction step was not completed yet starting from the top. Reply according to the instruction step which were not completed. Move to the next instruction step only when you completed all previous instruction steps.

Instruction step format:

INSTRUCTION STEPS:
>>>Greeting: Start with a warm and professional greeting. Introduce yourself and ask if you can assist the User.

>>>Closing the Conversation: End with a summary of the discussed points and send a booking link for them to use the booking link: www.KatyasResorts.com/book. Tell the User that if the room is booked within the next 30 min you can provide an additional 10% discount.
>>>Farewell: Say thank you very emotionally if User decides to book or suggest to stay in touch if the User decides not to book.

AGENT-USER MEMORY:

{{memory}}
{{agent_}}:{{~/system}}

{{#assistant~}}
{{gen(name='RESULT', temperature=0.75)}}
{{~/assistant}}

{{#user~}}
Q: Based on the User's replies, name the location where the User is interested to stay, just state and city. Don't explain. If the location was not indicated, say "The location is not defined".
A: {{~/user}}

{{#assistant~}}
{{gen(name='location', temperature=0.6)}}
{{~/assistant}}

{{#user~}}
{{SetState(name='hotel_description', value=SearchFuzzyAkb(query=location, fields=["summary"], numberTopics = 1))}} 
{{~/user}}
```

A few things to note regarding the Skill Script:

*   The "BIOGRAPHY" has changed to match the use case for this agent. We are now speaking to an agent who can advise on multiple hotel locations instead of just one.
*   The "INSTRUCTION STEPS" contain a new step for the agent to ask about what hotel location they want to stay in. This is important to be able to retrieve location-specific information from the AKB.
*   The "CONTEXT" now only contains the various hotel locations. A GetState action has been used, which calls the State Field "hotel\_description" and inserts its information at that point in the prompt. The basic hotel location is needed in the Skill Script to allow the agent to respond and source the correct information from the AKB once a user mentions a hotel location.
*   The "AGENT-USER MEMORY" section contains a multi-step LLM call and an AKB search, which will be explained further below.

Click **Save** at the top-right corner of the Flow Builder.

The "hotel\_description" State Field needs to be created to store the description of a specific hotel obtained from the AKB. Each time a user sends a message in the Sandbox chat and the Skill is activated, the information within the "hotel\_description" is used to create the prompt to send to the LLM.

1.  Click **+** icon next to the "State Fields" label on the right-side panel of the Flow Builder.
2.  Add the "State title" as "Hotel Description."
3.  Add the "State Idn" as "hotel\_description."
4.  Leave the "State default value" empty.
5.  Select "user" from the "State scope" dropdown.
6.  Click **Create**.

The context removed from the Skill Script needs to be added to the AKB, along with the context of all other hotels.

1.  Click **Open AKB** at the top-left of the Flow Builder.
2.  Ensure the correct agent is selected from the dropdown on the top-left.
3.  Click **Add New Topic** at the top-right.
4.  Add all information relevant to your first hotel as follows:
    1.  "Name" - Name of the hotel.
    2.  "Summary" - All the details about that hotel.
    3.  "Facts" - Name of the hotel and the location.
    4.  "Confidence" - Move the slider to 100%. This is how certain you are that the information is correct.
    5.  "Source" - Leave empty for now.
    6.  "Label" - Leave empty for now.
5.  Click **Create**.
6.  Repeat steps 3 to 5 with the information about the other hotels.

For testing, here is the summary information on three hotels you can use to create topics in the AKB:

```

```
The location is not defined
```

Additionally, add the text "The location is not defined" as a topic in the AKB (copy/paste into the Name, Summary, and Facts fields), which will ensure hotel information is only pulled when a location is mentioned.

Click **Save and Publish**, type “Hello” into the Sandbox chat, and click the **send** icon. The agent should now respond to you and walk through the instructions steps. When asked about the hotel location, an AKB search will pull the correct information about the hotel in that location so you can ask questions about its availability.

It is important to understand what is happening in the Skill Script to be able to build your own agents for a particular use case. Let's walk through what happens during a normal conversation with this agent.

When sending "Hello" in the Sandbox chat, besides the operations performed by the set and memory commands and actions, the first {{assistant}} block generates a response based on the user's message and the instruction step. In this case, the instruction step is for the agent to greet the user. This response is sent to the Sandbox chat.

During this generation, the {{user}} block acts as an artificial user in the background asking the agent whether a location has been mentioned.

Since a location is not yet mentioned by the user, the response of the second {{assistant}} block is simply "The location is not defined." This response is not output into the Sandbox chat since only the "RESULT" variable gets printed (as set up under "Skill Settings").

However, the response is used as the search query for the SearchFuzzyAkb action, which returns the "The location is not defined" topic and adds it to "hotel\_description."

Type "I'd like to book a hotel room" into the Sandbox chat and click the **send** icon. The first {{assistant}} block will generate a response based on the user's message and the instruction step. In this case, the instruction step is for the agent to ask about a location.

Since a location has still not been mentioned by the user, the response of the second {{assistant}} block is, again, "The location is not defined."

Type "Arizona" into the Sandbox chat and click the **send** icon. The first {{assistant}} block will generate a response based on the user's message and the instruction step. In this case, the instruction step is for the agent to ask what days the user is planning to stay.

However, now that a location has been mentioned by the user, the response of the second {{assistant}} block will be the location mentioned by the user. This response is now used as the search query for the SearchFuzzyAkb action, which returns the context associated with that location and adds it to "hotel\_description."

Now a user can ask specific questions about this location because its context will be added to each prompt. If another location is mentioned, the above steps loop, and "hotel\_description" is updated with the related context.
