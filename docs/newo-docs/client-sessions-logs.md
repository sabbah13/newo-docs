The Client Session Logs Google Sheet allows your AI agent to log inbound call data at the end of a session. Here are some key features:

*   Collect call information, such as user name, phone, and messages.
*   Automatically determine if a call is an emergency.
*   Get a full summary of the call.
*   Know whether a call was taken during working hours or non-working hours.
*   Define a call's category (info, meeting, etc.).
*   Calculate the potential revenue of a call.
