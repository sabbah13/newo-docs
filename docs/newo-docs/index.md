# How to Use This Documentation

Welcome to the **Newo.ai Documentation**! The below guide is designed to help you navigate our extensive documentation, whether you're a beginner or an advanced developer.

*   If you want a **ready-made AI agent** that has all the out-of-the-box functionality you'd expect and that you can then customize to your liking without coding experience, go directly to the **[Super Agent Creation](#)** section. **This section is where most of our customers start.**
*   If you want to understand **the foundational concepts** behind how our agents are built, start with the **[Basic](#) and [Intermediate Agent Creation](#)** sections.

> ❗️
> 
> ### 
> 
> We recommend these sections if you're a developer and want to start with the basics before moving to more advanced code. Beginners can also navigate these sections if you're looking to expand your knowledge of AI Employee systems.

*   If you're a **developer looking for advanced customization**, check out **[Actions](#) and [Identifiers & Selectors](#)** for advanced agent behavior.
