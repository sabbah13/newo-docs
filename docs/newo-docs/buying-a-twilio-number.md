# Buying a Twilio Number

By default, the Twilio integration provided by Newo.ai restricts each AI agent to a maximum of **10 outbound calls per day**. This constraint is in place due to security, anti-spam, and privacy requirements.

To overcome this limitation and allow your AI agents to make more than 10 outbound calls daily, it's recommended to purchase a dedicated Twilio phone number. By acquiring your own Twilio number and integrating it with your Newo.ai agents, you can customize and potentially increase the call limits according to your specific needs.

Here are two Twilio resources to help buy a number:

*   [Upgrading to a Paid Twilio Account](https://help.twilio.com/articles/223183208-Upgrading-to-a-paid-Twilio-Account)

> By default all capabilities (Voice, SMS, MMS, and Fax) are checked for searching. Ensure you uncheck capabilities that are not needed as it will impact the returned search results. Moreover, if you require your AI Agent to send an SMS to user's or manager's, ensure your phone number has SMS functionality enabled.

Navigate to your Twilio account to **My first Twilio account** at the top-left corner (unless you have multiple Twilio accounts, in which case, navigate to the account you have purchased a new number in). Under "Account Info," you will see your "Account SID" and "Auth Token." Copy these values to your clipboard.
