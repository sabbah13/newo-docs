**Digital Employees**, often referred to as **Digital Workers, Non-Human Workers, or Intelligent Agents**, are software-driven entities capable of autonomously performing end-to-end work processes using a diverse set of Skills.

The specific tasks and responsibilities of Digital Employees vary based on their job role, industry, and the objectives set by the manager or employer.

Digital Employees are artificial intelligence (AI) agents characterized by four key elements:

1.  Presence in the physical world.
2.  Omnichannel capabilities.
3.  Omniflow capabilities.
4.  Omniuser capabilities.

This category of agents stands out from regular intelligent agents (there’s a big difference!). They can augment the behavior of real-world (physical office) receptionists, concierges, salespeople, consultants, and other biological employees.
