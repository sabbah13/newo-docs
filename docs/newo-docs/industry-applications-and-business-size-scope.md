![](https://files.readme.io/e2ceaa8-_76f93929-7840-4a3d-bab5-bab294149ba0.jpeg)

Can an AI agent be used in any industry and are there any noticeable benefits when used by either a solopreneur or a large enterprise?

The short answer is: Yes and yes!

Here are just a few industries we’ve seen take full advantage of an AI agent:

*   Hospitality (Hotels, restaurants)
*   Consumer Retail (Various sectors)
*   Personal services (Wellness, beauty)
*   Finance (Banking)
*   Manufacturing and construction
*   Real estate (Transactions, property management)
*   Healthcare (Private practices)

Here are the business size scopes that have seen the most benefits from an AI agent (Spoiler alert: all business sizes have found AI agents tremendously useful):

*   Solopreneurs
*   Small businesses (Under 50 employees)
*   Medium businesses (50-250 employees)
*   Large businesses (250-1000 employees)
*   Enterprises (Over 1000 employees)
*   And beyond!
