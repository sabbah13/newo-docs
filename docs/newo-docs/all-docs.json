They make excellent family pets, service dogs, and companions. Here's a detailed history and some interesting facts about Golden Retrievers:\n\n### Origin and History:\n\n- **Development**: Golden Retrievers were originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century. Dudley Marjoribanks, also known as Lord Tweedmouth, is credited with developing the breed. He aimed to create a dog that was loyal, kind, and skilled in retrieving game from both land and water.\n\n- **Ancestry**: The breed was developed by crossing a now-extinct yellow-colored retriever, the Tweed Water Spaniel (also extinct), with the Irish Setter, Bloodhound, and other breeds. This mix was intended to produce a skilled retrieving dog that could perform in the rainy climate and rugged terrain of the Scottish Highlands.\n\n- **Recognition**: The breed was first exhibited in a British dog show in 1908. The Golden Retriever was officially recognized by The Kennel Club of England in 1911 as \"Retriever — Yellow or Golden.\" Later, it was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1925.\n\n### Characteristics:\n\n- **Appearance**: Golden Retrievers have a dense, water-repellent outer coat with a thick undercoat. While their coats are generally golden in color, shades can vary from light cream to dark gold.\n\n- **Temperament**: They are known for their friendly, gentle, and patient temperament, making them excellent family pets. They are also highly intelligent and trainable, which is why they are frequently used as guide dogs, search-and-rescue dogs, and in other service roles.\n\n- **Size**: Adult males typically weigh between 65-75 pounds (29-34 kg), and females weigh between 55-65 pounds (25-29 kg).\n\n### Health and Lifespan:\n\n- **Lifespan**: Golden Retrievers typically live between 10 to 12 years.\n\n- **Common Health Issues**: They are prone to certain genetic disorders such as hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, heart problems, and eye conditions. Cancer rates are also notably high in the breed.\n\n### Interesting Facts:\n\n1. **Versatile Workers**: Aside from their traditional roles in hunting and retrieving, Golden Retrievers excel in a variety of roles including drug detection, therapy work, and competitive events such as obedience and agility trials.\n\n2. **Famous Goldens**: Several Golden Retrievers have gained fame through movies and TV shows, including \"Air Bud\" and \"Comet\" from \"Full House.\"\n\n3. **Presidential Pets**: U.S. Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan both had Golden Retrievers while in office.\n\n4. **Guinness World Record**: A Golden Retriever named \"Augie\" holds the record for holding five tennis balls in his mouth at one time.\n\n5. **Intelligent and Trainable**: They rank fourth in Stanley Coren's \"The Intelligence of Dogs,\" being one of the brightest dogs ranked by obedience-command trainability.\n\nGolden Retrievers continue to be one of the most popular dog breeds worldwide due to their versatile nature, friendly disposition, and loyalty. They serve not only as family pets but also as invaluable working dogs, excelling in various roles due to their intelligence, trainability, and friendly nature.\n\nFacts:\n- Origin: Scotland, mid-19th century.\n- Developer: Lord Tweedmouth.\n- Ancestry: Cross of yellow-colored retriever, Tweed Water Spaniel, Irish Setter, Bloodhound.\n- First exhibition: 1908 in Britain.\n- Recognition: The Kennel Club of England in 1911, American Kennel Club in 1925.\n- Appearance: Dense, water-repellent outer coat, light cream to dark gold color.\n- Temperament: Friendly, gentle, patient.\n- Size: Males 65-75 pounds, females 55-65 pounds.\n- Lifespan: 10-12 years.\n- Health issues: Hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, heart problems, eye conditions, high cancer rates.\n- Roles: Hunting, retrieving, guide dogs, search-and-rescue, drug detection, therapy work.\n- Famous examples: \"Air Bud,\" \"Comet\" from \"Full House.\"\n- Presidential pets: Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan.\n- Guinness World Record: \"Augie\" held five tennis balls in mouth.\n- Intelligence ranking: Fourth in obedience-command trainability.\n\nConfidence: 100%\n  \nSource: empty\n\nLabels: empty\n```\n\n```\nName:\njack russel\n\nSummary:\nJack Russell Terriers are energetic, bold, and intelligent dogs known for their small size and fearless nature.

Our platform enables the rapid development of Digital Employees, which are more than mere programs – they are Digital Workers poised to undertake roles traditionally filled by human staff.\n\nNewo Inc. is a creator of a low-code platform where integrators and businesses build “digital employees” - human-level AI agents. Distinct from AI agents created on conventional builders, Newo.ai’s “digital employees” are ready out of the box to communicate with clients, company employees, and managers through familiar human channels—phone, SMS, email, online chat, Instagram, and messengers.\n\nThey can also perform business actions like bookings, reservations, and appointment settings in browsers, CRMs, and ERPs, simulating mouse and keyboard actions. As a result, these digital employees do not require months of technical integration but can be “hired” within a few hours.\n\nNewo.ai Agents are designed to be integral team members, working in tandem with human colleagues to enhance efficiency, ease the burden of urgent tasks, and foster a healthier work-life balance. They assume the brunt of repetitive and routine tasks, allowing your human team to devote more time to family, friends, and higher-level strategic and creative pursuits.\n\nThe cornerstone of Newo.ai Agents is the Newo Omnichannel Architecture (NOA) alongside the Newo Intelligent Flow (NIF) capabilities. These features facilitate seamless omnichannel communication, encompassing voice, email, messaging, and even an in-person-like presence.\n\nThey adeptly recognize individuals across different channels, consolidating communication histories and rationales.

This digital employee needs to handle various tasks:\n\n*   Phone call management\n*   Providing information on availability and pricing\n*   Making reservations\n*   Managing emails and messages\n*   Interacting on social media platforms\n*   Welcoming guests in person at reception\n\nLLMs lack the necessary integrations with your specific reservation system, telephone, email, and social platforms. They also require tailored corporate directives to interact and serve guests correctly – guidelines you would typically provide to new human hires.\n\nThe Newo.ai platform bridges these gaps. It empowers you to create a digital employee without any coding, capable of engaging with customers and staff and executing complex tasks.\n\nNewo.ai's Digital Employees transcend the capabilities of traditional bots. They are agents to whom you assign objectives and rules of operation, akin to human workers. These agents then autonomously perform tasks, navigating the workflow with built-in advanced functions like long-term memory, logical reasoning, external system access, conflict escalation, and task prioritization.\n\nThis not only elevates customer service but also boosts revenue and significantly enhances the work-life balance of your human employees.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

A car with automated features like cruise control or obstacle avoidance but still needs a driver doesn’t fully relieve humans from driving. Such a car remains a “tool” requiring human operation.\n\nIn contrast, a fully driverless car, which operates without a driver, fundamentally differs from other intelligent cars by eliminating human involvement in driving, both operationally and financially.\n\nIn this metaphor, the car with automated features is akin to regular intelligent agents requiring human intervention, while the fully driverless car is akin to Digital Employees.\n\nThis distinction is what sets Newo.ai apart. We’re not just creating a regular class of intelligent agents but a class of “digital employees.”\n\n**Newo.ai is like a WordPress builder for creating AI Digital Employees. This means they embody 4 elements: presence in the physical world, omnichannel, omniflow and omniuser capabilities.**\n\nTo our knowledge, no other intelligent agent builder currently allows businesses to create a digital employee class agent in 2 hours, 2 days, or even 2 weeks. While it’s theoretically possible to create a digital employee class of intelligent agent using Python or regular Agent builders, it would likely take many many months to achieve and will also need ongoing efforts to maintain and keep them updated.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *\n\nDid this page help you?\n\nYes\n\nNo"

Even a simple business task is not a tram ride with pre-known stops. It's a journey from point A to B in a metropolis during rush hour, where you can get there by thousands of different routes, and decisions on how exactly to proceed need to be made on the fly, taking into account dynamic external data, previous experience, and the goal set.\n\nLet's say a customer calls your hotel asking about available rooms for the weekend. They need two standard rooms. But let's assume you don't have two standard rooms available. However, you do have a two-bedroom suite. The agent should not just refuse the booking but inquire if the customer (possibly a family of two adults and two children) would be satisfied with the suite.\n\nAnd if they decline (perhaps because the suite is more expensive than two standard rooms), could a discount be offered? Or offer one double room and one single room but add an extra bed? And so on.\n\nCreating old-fashioned bots a few years ago, we had to write down all these possible branches manually. But it was extremely labor-intensive, it greatly annoyed customers (remember calling an airline and encountering that terrible bot?), and these monstrous rule-based bot scenarios were extremely difficult to maintain in working order.\n\nNewo.ai Digital Employees don't require all possible rules to be written down. You tell them in the instructions much like you would explain to your biological employee: “If the requested rooms for the specified dates are not available, negotiate and find possible compromises. For example, offer a different combination of rooms (and if it turns out to be more expensive, you can give a discount, but only up to 10%), or propose slightly different check-in/check-out dates.” That's all. And it will work. This feature of the Newo.ai platform is called Intelligent Flow.\n\n**Stateless nature:** An LLM doesn't remember anything between its calls. The model doesn't remember the conversation history, your client's name, or the name of your hotel. To ensure that the model consistently communicates with each of your clients or employees, orchestration is needed in restoring recent conversation history with the client and important facts from long-term memory. This is also handled by the Newo.ai platform, storing and retrieving necessary parts of the conversation and other facts from memory.\n\n**External data (Static and dynamic):** Ask ChatGPT how much a suite costs in your hotel today. Naturally, the model won't be able to answer. To do so, it needs to “see” the current prices from your reservation system. That is, special orchestration is needed for dynamic communication between your digital employees and your external corporate systems.\n\nIf such data changes rarely (documentation in Confluence, articles on your website, your corporate PDF documents, etc.), we call them static external data. If the data can change hourly or minute-by-minute (Jira tickets, CRM records, ERP, HIRS data, financial systems, etc.), we call them dynamic data.\n\n**Hallucinations:** In industrial use, we can't afford for the model to make up facts about your products and services. We need deterministic results. Moreover, LLMs sometimes fail when asked to do calculations, execute code, or run algorithms. Special built-in checks need to be orchestrated to ensure the stable operation of your intelligent agent.\n\n**Human in the loop, privacy, security, and compliance:** Many systems must take special care that LLMs do not exfiltrate private data, access data or APIs they aren’t authorized for, and do not return offensive or undesirable responses.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

That's precisely why the market today offers platforms for creating digital employees.\n\nSo, what is the distinction of the Newo.ai platform compared to other platforms?\n\n1.  **Omnichannel communication:** At the forefront of Newo.ai's capabilities is the Newo Omnichannel Architecture (NOA). Unlike other platforms that require extensive development to link customer interactions across various channels, Newo.ai offers a pre-configured solution. It recognizes that Max calling from 611-700-1234 yesterday, emailing from [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#660b071e1314545257574800091e26010b070f0a4805090b) last month, and leaving a Yelp review as Max1234, is the same individual. This seamless integration of communication streams is a turnkey feature with NOA.\n2.  **Physical presence in business:** Newo.ai excels in environments that require a physical presence, like a friendly robot greeter named Moxie. Right from the start, Newo.ai equips businesses with the ability to engage with clients face-to-face in settings like receptions, showrooms, and exhibitions – a critical function for entities with a brick-and-mortar footprint.\n3.  **Collaborative workflows:** Newo.ai is designed to handle complex workflows. Take, for example, the mass recruitment for a retail chain, encompassing over a dozen steps (bulleted below). Descriptions of such pipelines apply to most corporate business processes, from sales funnels to employee onboarding, from processing financial documents to supply management. Programming such intricate workflows can be a lengthy process on other platforms and take months, but with Newo.ai, setting up these operations can be accomplished in weeks.\n\n*   Searching for hundreds of candidates on various resources and collecting their contacts to place in the first column of a huge table (or creating a lead in CRM).\n*   Preliminary checking of their CVs.\n*   Calling candidates to find out if they are still looking for a job.\n*   If so, schedule the first interview.\n*   Conducting the first interview.\n*   If successful, conduct a second interview.\n*   Sending documents to be signed for a trial work period.\n*   Coordinating the day and time for a trial workday.\n*   Collecting feedback from the team leader about the quality of work on the first day.\n*   If successful, send the main work documents.\n*   Ensuring the documents are signed and sending necessary job descriptions and rules.\n*   Checking the knowledge of job descriptions and rules.\n\n4.  **Newo Intelligent Flow (NIF) and Active Knowledge Base (AKB):** Newo AKB, a unique vector database, doesn't just store corporate documents and communication histories. It also retains scenarios and work instructions – hence its designation as an Active Knowledge Base. By uploading job instructions to Newo AKB, you automatically revise the working scenarios of your digital employees, streamlining workflow adjustments without reprogramming.\n5.  **Voice command instructions:** Following the innovative NIF, the Newo.ai platform supports modifying digital employee instructions via voice commands – an advanced feature that enhances managerial efficiency.\n6.  **Agent versioning tools:** Built-in versioning tools within Newo.ai facilitate the release of new agent iterations to a limited audience for testing and refinement, streamlining the development process.\n7.  **Advanced event management:** Newo.ai offers sophisticated event management capabilities, enabling agents to respond coherently to external events (like Yelp reviews or incoming calls) and internal business occurrences (such as in-house temperature changes or financial system updates).\n8.  **Advanced crawler management:** The Newo.ai platform incorporates a unique system for collecting data from corporate sources, allowing customization of the depth of crawling, the parameters of zigzagging traversal of links and documents for static and dynamic corporate data sources (i.e., Confluence knowledge bases, multi-page PDF manuals and documentation, invoices, contracts, CSV format product nomenclatures, open Jira tickets, etc.). This is fundamentally necessary when building industrial intelligent agents so that when agents operate, you precisely know which of your documents have already been updated in the vector database and which have not.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

This speed facilitates immediate integration into your business processes.\n*   **Efficient development of complex agents:** The time required to develop intricate corporate agents is drastically compressed, from several months to just days or weeks (8x less time than other platforms). This efficiency gain represents a fourfold acceleration in deploying digital employees, greatly enhancing business agility.\n*   **Scalable growth:** One of the most significant advantages of the Newo.ai platform is its scalability. As your business grows and your AI automation needs to become more sophisticated, there's no need to migrate to a different platform. Newo.ai supports the evolution from straightforward, no-code agents to a robust array of enterprise-grade AI solutions. More importantly, it does so while retaining all historical communication data and refined knowledge within the same ecosystem, ensuring continuity and deepening the value of your digital workforce over time.\n\nThe key value for businesses using Newo.ai digital employees is increased new revenue, repeat sales, customer satisfaction, and cost reduction. For example, a historical calculation for a real restaurant in Menlo Park, CA, USA:\n\n*   Total calls handled by Newo.ai AI Hostess: 610/mo\n*   Table bookings and large group reservations secured: $87,000\n*   From business hour calls: $67,500\n*   From off-hour calls: $19,500\n\nIn total, after implementing the Newo.ai AI Hostess, the restaurant earned an additional $33,400 per month or $401,000 per year.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

	"markdown": "# Intelligent Framework\n\nThe Newo Intelligent Flow Framework, also referred to as the Newo Framework, is a high-level framework that enables rapid development of Intelligent Agents (IAs). Anyone without special programming skills can create an intelligent agent.\n\nThe image further below highlights the Newo.ai platform architecture. It comprises several main areas working together:\n\n*   End users\n*   Interface layer\n*   Newo.ai platform\n*   Generative models layer\n*   Customer organization\n*   Static and dynamic data\n\nEnd users (i.e., human users) interact with digital employees (or digital agents) via a physical interface layer. Users are usually thought of as external to an organization using the Newo.ai platform but can also be internal users who need to communicate with the agent for testing purposes.\n\nThe physical interface layer communicates with the intelligent agents by sending/receiving information via the Newo API. Information can be sent back to the end user via the interface layer.\n\nFlow designers and organizations can interact with the Newo API via the platform to create agents to suit their needs. The agents require access to the generative models layer via an LLM API (residing outside the the Newo.ai platform) to produce appropriate results/responses to end users. Additionally, to provide contextual prompts to the LLM, external static and dynamic data are retrieved from various connected sources.\n\nStatic data is data that does not change frequently, such as a website, PDF with instructions, or troubleshooting documents. Dynamic data is data that changes frequently and, therefore, needs to be observed often.\n\nFor example, during a call between a user and a hotel receptionist agent, the agent may need to retrieve information immediately from a list of known available hotel rooms and updated pricing. In order for the Newo.ai platform to connect to the outside world and interface layer, integrations are needed with a connector for each.\n\nHere’s the interesting part: The Newo.ai platform has the out-of-the-box ability for an agent to talk to a user using different communication channels. For example, a user (human) can communicate with a digital employee of a hotel via a phone call, Moxie Robot, lobby smart speaker, email, SMS, or any other form of communication.\n\nInitially, the Newo.ai system may see these different communications from this single person as different actors, but later, as soon as the system understands that all the actors belong to the same user, they will be merged into the same user. This mapping of different physical world communication channels to the same historical memory and persona of a user is what makes the Newo.ai platform stand out.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/9f5f998-Newo.AI_Platform_Architecture.png)\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

The agent must be able to identify each user individually and link them to their respective histories.\n\nSolving this problem includes:\n\n*   Speaker separation, which involves distinguishing the voice of a specific speaker from signals in a multi-speaker public space through methods like voice IDs, face IDs, and control words. This requires integrating face recognition and voice prints with user database management.\n*   End-of-speech prediction/detection, which is a significant challenge in noisy public environments.\n*   Predicting the last words for early Speech-to-Text (STT) submission to achieve agent response times of less than 500 milliseconds.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *\n\nDid this page help you?\n\nYes\n\nNo"

This approach assumes including the external information in the prompt effectively expanding its knowledge base beyond what it was initially trained on.\n\nRAG first uses a retriever component to fetch relevant documents or data from a large corpus based on the input query or context. It then passes this retrieved information along with the original input to a generator model, synthesizing the inputs to produce a coherent and contextually informed response.\n\nOne of the key benefits of RAG is its ability to stay up-to-date with the latest information and facts, as it can retrieve from the most recent documents in its corpus. This makes it particularly useful for applications where the freshness of information is crucial, such as news summarization or real-time Q&A systems.\n\nAdditionally, RAG provides more explainable AI outputs, as the sources of its generated content can be traced back to the specific documents it retrieved during the generation process. This transparency is beneficial for critical applications where understanding the basis of the AI's response is essential.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

Every coder writes a “Hello World” program for their first exercise, which helps highlight some basic functionality of a coding environment. This is no exception with the Newo.ai platform. We can break down several Newo.ai actions and get you familiar with the platform using this basic example.\n\n**Goal:** Have the Agent send “Hello World” in the Sandbox chat panel after triggering an event. No LLM involvement.\n\n1.  Navigate to the Agents page, click the **three dots** icon at the top-right, and click **Create Agent**.\n2.  Add an `Idn`, a unique identifier for your new Agent.\n3.  Add a `Title` and a `Description` to describe the Agent within the platform. The fields are optional but will help when creating many Agents for different purposes later.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/8168d2715b46884ca5439d52b8402d167d62b34cbaddea9412894fe00cfa20ec-Screenshot_2025-03-14_at_09.21.01.png)\n\n4.  Click the **+** icon by the `Persona` field.\n5.  Add a `Name`, `Title`, and `Description`. This is the persona the Agent will assume. For example, the Agent's name could be Dillian, and the title could be Receptionist. Later, you will see that your Agent Persona can have context and instructions stored in the AKB.\n6.  Click **Create**.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/443b29698c2b2cc5072356c78426d17cd110e095979431f1c1ec97c0f9d95d63-Screenshot_2025-03-14_at_09.27.11.png)\n\n7.  Click **Update** to save the Agent. If you need to change the Agent details, click the **pencil** icon.\n\nIn order for the Newo.ai platform to connect to a Sandbox chat, integrations are needed with a connector.\n\n1.  To create a new Sandbox connector, navigate to the Integrations page from the left-side panel.\n2.  Click the **plus** icon on the `Sandbox Integration` item.\n3.  Add a `Title` and `Idn`. In this case, just use `hello_connector` for both for simplicity.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/0b95c3ee72236bc0281f70d159ccc54e49f519d32c10e2d6242d39f5b3d7fe27-Screenshot_2025-03-14_at_09.31.56.png)\n\n4.  Click **Save**.\n\nOnce a connector is created, it should automatically start running. If not, and you see the status as `Stopped`, you will need to enable it.\n\n1.  Click the **three dots** icon on the right of the created connector.\n2.  Click **Run**. The status will change to `Running`.\n\n1.  Navigate to the Agents page.\n2.  Click the **plus** icon next to the newly created Agent.\n3.  Add a `Flow Idn`. For example, `ReceptionistFlow`. Ensure there are no spaces.\n4.  Add a `Flow Title`, which is used to describe the Flow within the platform. In most cases, add the same name as the `Flow Idn`.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/fa5dfb10534c0fc6d8915cdb98416ccd3d27a56dc47c691317de72614b667e1f-Screenshot_2025-03-14_at_09.39.57.png)\n\n5.

Click the **plus** icon next to the Skills section on the left-side panel.\n2.  Add a `Skill Idn`. Ensure there are no spaces.\n3.  Add a `Skill title`. This is merely used as a description of the Skill (optional).\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/badcba893c617b43d4c50ee1e405397ea24d0b909a526e36e5dbb1bfcfed06c1-Screenshot_2025-03-14_at_09.45.59.png)\n\n4.  Click **Create** to save the Skill.\n\nNote that `Skill Settings` appears on the right. This displays the Skills `Title`, `Idn`, `Model`, `Result action`, and `Result variable name`.\n\nThe `SendMessage` action is used to send plain text to the Sandbox chat. Copy the following code into the Skill Script section (i.e., the middle section of the interface):\n\n```\n{{SendMessage(message=\"Hello World\")}}\n```\n\nIn order for the newly created Skill to be activated, the Skill needs to be subscribed to an Event. This is because the Agent needs to know when or what Event needs to happen to send the message \"Hello World.\" In this case, the Event trigger will be a message sent in the Sandbox chat.\n\n1.  Click the **plus** icon next to the Event Subscription section on the left-side panel.\n2.  Under `Event Idn`, select `user_message` from the dropdown.\n3.  Under `Integration`, select `sandbox` from the dropdown.\n4.  Under `Connector`, select `hello_connector` from the dropdown.\n5.  Under `Skill selector`, select `skill_idn` from the dropdown.

Ensure the correct Agent persona is selected from the dropdown (i.e, Dillian).\n2.  Click the **plus** icon next to the `User` section.\n3.  Add a `Name`. In this case, this is the name of a user who will be talking to the Agent, which can be your name or a made-up name for testing purposes.\n4.  Ensure the `Create actor` checkbox has been selected. An Actor is someone who communicates through a specific connector. For example, a specific user could communicate via the Sandbox chat (Sandbox chat connector) and over the phone (Vapi connector), which each have identifiers of separate Actors. In this case, we are going to create a single Actor for Sandbox chat communications.\n5.  Under the `Actor settings`, select `sandbox` for the `Integration` and `hello_connector` for the `Connector`.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/b0b37b8284ebeb7473763c18ca2c980714837c2755d672eca74228c0b590de5f-Screenshot_2025-03-14_at_10.00.00.png)\n\n6.  Click **Create and apply** to save the user.\n\n1.  Click **Save and Publish** in the top-right corner of the Flow Builder.\n2.  Type anything in the Sandbox chat field, and click the **send** icon.

Two main reasons:\n\n*   To save time.\n*   To save money.\n\nMost LLMs have limitations on the amount of information that can be fed to them. Therefore, you are limited by how much information you can add directly to the Skill Script. The more information sent to an LLM, the slower it gets to generate a response. This can also result in your Intelligent Agent failing to do their job, resulting in a loss of revenue for the company integrating the agent.\n\nBy moving context information to an external database, we can search, extract, and feed a small, relevant portion of the information contained within a larger information set to the LLM. This saves time and money.\n\n**Goal:** Remove context information from the Skill Script and retrieve it from AKB.\n\nLet's use the same agent setup as with the \"[Embedded Instructions](https://docs.newo.ai/docs/embedded-instructions)\" example.

Reply according to the instruction step which were not completed. Move to the next instruction step only when you completed all previous instruction steps.\n\nInstruction step format: \n>>>instruction step description\n\nINSTRUCTION STEPS:\n>>>Greeting: Start with a warm and professional greeting.

We are now speaking to an agent who can advise on multiple hotel locations instead of just one.\n*   The \"INSTRUCTION STEPS\" contain a new step for the agent to ask about what hotel location they want to stay in. This is important to be able to retrieve location-specific information from the AKB.\n*   The \"CONTEXT\" now only contains the various hotel locations. A GetState action has been used, which calls the State Field \"hotel\\_description\" and inserts its information at that point in the prompt. The basic hotel location is needed in the Skill Script to allow the agent to respond and source the correct information from the AKB once a user mentions a hotel location.\n*   The \"AGENT-USER MEMORY\" section contains a multi-step LLM call and an AKB search, which will be explained further below.\n\nClick **Save** at the top-right corner of the Flow Builder.\n\nThe \"hotel\\_description\" State Field needs to be created to store the description of a specific hotel obtained from the AKB. Each time a user sends a message in the Sandbox chat and the Skill is activated, the information within the \"hotel\\_description\" is used to create the prompt to send to the LLM.\n\n1.  Click **+** icon next to the \"State Fields\" label on the right-side panel of the Flow Builder.\n2.  Add the \"State title\" as \"Hotel Description.\"\n3.  Add the \"State Idn\" as \"hotel\\_description.\"\n4.  Leave the \"State default value\" empty.\n5.  Select \"user\" from the \"State scope\" dropdown.\n6.  Click **Create**.\n\nThe context removed from the Skill Script needs to be added to the AKB, along with the context of all other hotels.\n\n1.  Click **Open AKB** at the top-left of the Flow Builder.\n2.  Ensure the correct agent is selected from the dropdown on the top-left.\n3.  Click **Add New Topic** at the top-right.\n4.  Add all information relevant to your first hotel as follows:\n    1.  \"Name\" - Name of the hotel.\n    2.  \"Summary\" - All the details about that hotel.\n    3.  \"Facts\" - Name of the hotel and the location.\n    4.  \"Confidence\" - Move the slider to 100%. This is how certain you are that the information is correct.\n    5.  \"Source\" - Leave empty for now.\n    6.  \"Label\" - Leave empty for now.\n5.  Click **Create**.\n6.  Repeat steps 3 to 5 with the information about the other hotels.\n\nFor testing, here is the summary information on three hotels you can use to create topics in the AKB:\n\n```\nCarmel Ocean Inn \nSan Antonio Ave &, 12th Ave, Carmel-By-The-Sea\n\nCarmel Ocean Inn features individually decorated accommodations with free Wi-Fi.

The agent should now respond to you and walk through the instructions steps. When asked about the hotel location, an AKB search will pull the correct information about the hotel in that location so you can ask questions about its availability.\n\nIt is important to understand what is happening in the Skill Script to be able to build your own agents for a particular use case. Let's walk through what happens during a normal conversation with this agent.\n\nWhen sending \"Hello\" in the Sandbox chat, besides the operations performed by the set and memory commands and actions, the first {{assistant}} block generates a response based on the user's message and the instruction step. In this case, the instruction step is for the agent to greet the user. This response is sent to the Sandbox chat.\n\nDuring this generation, the {{user}} block acts as an artificial user in the background asking the agent whether a location has been mentioned.\n\nSince a location is not yet mentioned by the user, the response of the second {{assistant}} block is simply \"The location is not defined.\" This response is not output into the Sandbox chat since only the \"RESULT\" variable gets printed (as set up under \"Skill Settings\").\n\nHowever, the response is used as the search query for the SearchFuzzyAkb action, which returns the \"The location is not defined\" topic and adds it to \"hotel\\_description.\"\n\nType \"I'd like to book a hotel room\" into the Sandbox chat and click the **send** icon. The first {{assistant}} block will generate a response based on the user's message and the instruction step. In this case, the instruction step is for the agent to ask about a location.\n\nSince a location has still not been mentioned by the user, the response of the second {{assistant}} block is, again, \"The location is not defined.\"\n\nType \"Arizona\" into the Sandbox chat and click the **send** icon. The first {{assistant}} block will generate a response based on the user's message and the instruction step. In this case, the instruction step is for the agent to ask what days the user is planning to stay.\n\nHowever, now that a location has been mentioned by the user, the response of the second {{assistant}} block will be the location mentioned by the user. This response is now used as the search query for the SearchFuzzyAkb action, which returns the context associated with that location and adds it to \"hotel\\_description.\"\n\nNow a user can ask specific questions about this location because its context will be added to each prompt. If another location is mentioned, the above steps loop, and \"hotel\\_description\" is updated with the related context.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

	"markdown": "# Retrieve Instructions (RAI) from AKB\n\nIn the previous example, we used RAG to shift the context within our Skill Script to the Newo.ai Active Knowledge Base. However, for complex agents, the workflow instructions can also be quite lengthy and result in slow LLM responses. As such, we need to move the workflow instructions to the AKB.\n\n**Goal:** Remove workflow instructions from the Skill Script and retrieve them from the AKB.\n\nLet's use the same agent setup as with the \"[Retrieve Context from AKB](https://docs.newo.ai/docs/akb-context)\" example.

Each of these workflow names has a description, which will allow the agent to determine what instruction steps need to be retrieved from the AKB.\n*   The \"INSTRUCTION STEPS\" only contain the first Greeting step. Thereafter, the next instruction steps are retrieved from the AKB based on the workflow that best fits the user's replies. If a user changes their intent, new instructions steps will be retrieved. For example, the user shifts from wanting to book a room to wanting to cancel a booking they already have.\n*   The \"AGENT-USER MEMORY\" section is used twice in the Skill Script. The first instance of the memory section is to be able to determine the current workflow based on the user's most recent message. This workflow is used to query the AKB to retrieve the instruction steps. The second memory section assists with providing context to generate a response to the user.\n\nClick **Save** at the top-right corner of the Flow Builder.\n\nThe majority of the workflow instructions removed from the Skill Script need to be added to the AKB.\n\n1.  Click **Open AKB** at the top-left of the Flow Builder.\n2.  Ensure the correct agent is selected from the dropdown on the top-left.\n3.  Click **Add New Topic** at the top-right.\n4.  Add all workflow instructions and names as follows:\n    1.  \"Name\" - Workflow name.\n    2.  \"Summary\" - Workflow instructions.\n    3.  \"Facts\" - Workflow name.\n    4.  \"Confidence\" - Move the slider to 100%.

Repeat steps 3 to 5 with the other workflow instruction topics.\n\nFor testing, below are the AKB topics containing the workflow instructions. Copy each piece of information into the respective fields (Name, Summary, and Facts) when creating an AKB topic.\n\n```\nName (Workflow Name): \nreceiving_supplies\n\nSummary (Workflow Instructions):\n>>>If the person identifies as a delivery person, proceed with: \"Great, could you please provide your name and the delivery company you represent?\"\n\n>>>Confirming the Delivery Details:\n   - \"Thank you. Could you please confirm the recipient's name and the package details?\"\n   - Once the information is provided, cross-reference it with the hotel's delivery log or guest list to ensure accuracy.\n\n>>>Handling the Package:\n   - \"Everything seems in order. Please hand me the package. I will make sure it reaches the right person.\"\n   - If the package requires special handling (fragile, refrigerated, etc.), instruct accordingly: \"I see this is a fragile item. I'll handle it with extra care.\"\n\n>>>Acknowledgement and Documentation:\n   - \"I have received the package. Could you please sign our delivery log to confirm the handover?\"\n   - Offer a pen and the logbook to the delivery person for signature.\n\n>>>Providing Next Steps:\n   - \"Thank you for the delivery. I will ensure the package is securely stored and notify the recipient immediately.\"\n   - If the package is for a guest, mention that it will be sent to their room or held at the reception for pick-up as per hotel policy.\n   \nFacts (Workflow Name):\nreceiving_supplies\n```\n\n```\nName:\nsupporting_your_client\n\nSummary:\n>>>Comprehend the Problem:\n   - Actively listen to or read the user's concern to fully understand the specifics of the issue.\n   - Ask clarifying questions if necessary to ensure a complete grasp of the problem.\n\n>>>Formulate a Hypothesis:\n   - Based on the information gathered, develop a reasoned hypothesis about the potential cause of the issue.\n   - Use your knowledge base and previous similar cases to inform your hypothesis.\n\n>>>Propose a Solution:\n   - Offer a solution tailored to the context and specifics of the problem, leveraging your hypothesis.\n   - Ensure the solution is actionable and clear to the user.\n\n>>>Evaluate the Effectiveness of the Solution:\n   - Ask for feedback from the user to determine if the proposed solution resolved the issue.\n   - Be receptive to additional information or feedback that may alter your understanding of the problem.\n\n>>>Iterative Problem-Solving:\n   - If the issue is not resolved, revisit the problem comprehension step.

The agent should now respond to you and walk through the instructions steps based on the workflow. If you type \"I am interested in booking a room\" the AKB will pull the instruction steps from the selling\\_to\\_your\\_client AKB topic.\n\nIf you type \"I am delivering a package\" the AKB will pull the instruction steps from the receiving\\_supplies AKB topic. As with the previous example, when asked about the hotel location, an AKB search will pull the correct information about the hotel in that location so you can ask questions about its availability.\n\nWhen sending \"I am interested in booking a room\" in the Sandbox chat, the first memory section will add this message to the prompt that is sent to the LLM. Thanks to the Q&A section, the generated response from the assistant block will be the workflow that best matches the message. In this case, it would return the topic selling\\_to\\_your\\_client.\n\nThis generated response is used as the query in the SearchFuzzyAkb action, which will return the relevant workflow instructions from the AKB. These workflow instructions will be used throughout the conversation, unless the intent is changed to another topic.\n\nAs with the previous example, if a location is mentioned and it is within the workflow for selling\\_to\\_your\\_client, then hotel\\_description will contain the information from the AKB relevant to that location in order to answer any question a user has.\n\nImplement the agent and play around with changing topics mid-conversation to see how the information retrieved from the AKB changes and what the prompts look like after each agent response.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

Two flows can run in parallel, but each flow’s Skills run in succession. For example, the Email Worker and SMS Worker flow can run in parallel, but each skill within these flows run one after the other.\n*   **Skills:** Skills are isolated sub-programs within the agents.

For example, Skills within the Email Worker flow consist of email format, email send, and various other intermediate skills.\n*   **Events:** Events are triggers that initiate actions within the agents. For example, user messages via web chat, email, or voice call generate events that the agents respond to.\n*   **Main Skill:** The ConvoMainSkill (found within the CA Convo flow) is user-facing and processes user messages.

Let’s go through some things you will encounter:\n\n1.  **Newo Script:** This is the script language used within the agents, designed to feed information to Large Language Models (LLMs).\n2.  **System Blocks:** These blocks are where calculations occur before sending prompts to the LLM. They are defined by system block tags {{#system~}}{{/system}}. Everything outside of a system block does not produce text sent to the LLM.\n3.  **Assistant Blocks:** These blocks are instructions for the LLM on how to process prompts, including settings like temperature, which affects the randomness of the LLM's output. Near 0, more exact response, near 1, more creative. They are defined by assistant block tags {{#assistant~}}{{/assistant}}.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

	"markdown": "# Introduction to Workflow Stages\n\nA workflow consists of multiple stages, each managed by different agents. Let’s go through a particular use case of a restaurant table booking workflow to understand the various workflow stages and how information is passed from one stage to the next (i.e., how each agent passes its information to the next to perform its specific task).\n\nWithin the AKB, the Agent Main Instruction consists of the starting point instructions for the agent when a conversation (or event) is first started. It also contains the different workflows for a particular industry and prepares them to be able to shift to that particular workflow based on a user's needs. For example, if a super agent framework has been set for a restaurant, two workflows might be:\n\n*   **Table booking workflow** (denoted as w1 - workflow 1): If a user shows interest in booking a table.\n*   **Food delivery workflow** (denoted as w2 - workflow 2): If a user shows interest in ordering food.\n\nAlong with the Agent Main Instruction, several other pieces of context are used for context, which comes from a user's attributes (created when using the Quick Setup).\n\nLet’s say a user shows interest in booking a table. This involves workflow 1 (denoted by w1 as identified by its task\\_idn). The first stage of w1 is denoted by s1 and is managed by the Convo Agent, which collects user requirements such as date, time, and number of people for the table booking.\n\nThe Convo Agent stage requires the following AKB topics to function:\n\n*   **task\\_object\\_format:** A JSON structure representing the data collected at this stage. For example, in s1, the data needed will be the number of people, the date, and the time of the booking.\n*   **task\\_instruction:** Plain text instructions on how to conduct the conversation (e.g., fields to be collected and some context to use throughout the conversation). Think back to basic examples of creating agents using instruction steps – the same situation here.\n*   **task\\_context:** Any additional information you’d like to provide for the agent to know about. This can include, for example, menu items, high-level business knowledge, and so on, which would help the conversation flow of this stage between agent and user.\n\n> 📘\n\nThe output generated from the task\\_object\\_format is used as the input in the next stage of the flow (w1s2), and so on. Here’s a high-level overview of what the different stages might look like for a table booking workflow:\n\n*   Convo Agent Worker collects user requirements such as date, time, and number of people.\n*   A task object (containing the customer's desired timeslot for a booking) is created and fed as input into Stage 2.\n\n*   Took the desired time slots as input from Stage 1.\n*   Checks the available time slots on a service like OpenTable.\n*   Managed by a specialized agent, such as the Magic Worker.\n*   A task object is created based on the available slots around the desired time, which is fed as input into Stage 3.\n\n*   Took the actual available time slots as input from Stage 2.\n*   Convo Agent Worker confirms the available time slots with the user and collects other details necessary to make a booking, such as an email and phone number.\n*   Task object is created with the agreed time for the booking.\n\n*   Took the agreed time for the booking as input from Stage 3.\n*   Books the confirmed time slot by going back to OpenTable.\n*   Managed by the Magic Worker.\n\nAs you can see, each stage has a worker agent to help conduct the step. Other workers, such as the Sms Worker and Email Worker, can intervene to send communications to a manager to customers. However, in this case, OpenTable would send a booking confirmation to the user.\n\nWorkflow 2, for food orders, would follow a similar stage-by-stage flow but would include different Workers and instructions. The diagram below illustrates workflows and stages.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/ea98eb3-agent_logic_1.jpg)\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

We’re ready to help you rise to the next level.\"\n\n## Step 3. User Consultation: \nOnce you have asked all questions, tell the user: \"Thank you [user_name]. Maybe you have some questions? Feel free to ask.\" Use <BusinessContext> to answer all user's questions. Move to \"## Step 4\" if the User has no further questions.\n\n## Step 4. Book a Call: \nYou already know the user's full name; now, you need to ask for the remaining information below. Ask only one question at a time:\n- Ask the user: \"What is your preferred date and time for a meeting? We suggest [available slots].\" Available slots are: From Monday to Friday, from 9 am to 4 pm. If the user mentioned the day of the week or something like \"the day after tomorrow\", \"tomorrow\", \"next [day_of_week]\", or \"this [day_of_week]\" use the `ConvoAgent CALENDAR` to define provided preferred date and ask: \"Do you mean [such-and-such date]?\" Example: \"Do you mean 1st of May?\". You need to confirm the user's preferred date. Do not ask to confirm the time zone.\n- If user.email is not null tell the user: \"I see your email is [user.email]. Can I use it to create a meeting?\"\n- Once the user confirms, you can use email and ask to wait until you set up a meeting. Do not confirm the meeting has been created for now. DO NOT ask any further questions like a preferable method of communication or any clarity on questions from \"## Step 2.\"  \n- Wait until a message from you appears in the conversation history stating that the meeting has been created. Until then, tell the user that you are creating the meeting and that's it.\n- Once the user confirms that they see the invitation, move to \"## Step 6.\"\n\n## Step 5. Not Interested: \nIf the user indicates they’re not interested, say, \"Thank you for your time! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Have a great day!\" End the call.\n\n## Step 6. Finishing (Meeting Booked):\nSay to the User: \"Thank you for your time [user_name]! We look forward to meeting on [meeting date/day and time].\" Then, end the call.\n```\n\nWithin the Google Sheet, under the \"Outbound call list\" tab, you can add custom questions to rows U4 onwards. These questions are answered after the call by looking at the transcript and generating the responses. The values are then written back to the sheet for each lead.\n\nIf you’d like the answer to be in a specific format, simply provide this request in plain text. For example, “What is the monthly revenue of the User? (in the format $1,000,000).”\n\nThese custom questions won’t be mentioned in the call, so you must also ensure they are in your call instructions. Otherwise, the custom question column will return “null.”\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/14482a7077174d79c883f63367c7c23b670e72d37c21ca4a2e90f8b65bbde149-Screenshot_2024-11-18_at_21.47.03.png)\n\nUnder the \"Meta\" tab, you can select the maximum number of active calls and how many attempts your agent should try to make before moving on to the next lead.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/8c86fa22bf048019f3b1b518bcd0ddbca8d094ff63843a08e2f611f739ce6c47-Screenshot_2024-11-25_at_14.49.40.png)\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

	"url": "https://docs.newo.ai/docs/debugging",
	"markdown": "# Debugging\n\nIf you’ve received an incorrect, broken, or unexpected reply from your agent, you’ll need to debug the agent's answers. In electrical engineering, there is a simple principle:\n\n> There are only two reasons a device does not work – either there is no contact where it should be, or there is contact where it should not be.\n\nThis principle applies if an LLM generates an incorrect/bad response. Either it was not given the information it needed to generate the correct answer, or it was given the incorrect information.\n\nAn LLM is a function, which means it has input argument(s) and produces an output result. The input argument for an LLM is a prompt, which means that if something broke, something was missing in the prompt.\n\nSo, how do debug your agent that provided an incorrect/broken/unexpected reply? Follow these three steps:\n\n1.  Find the broken reply in the Sandbox chat history or in the logs.\n2.  Open the prompt which was sent to the LLM.\n3.  Read the prompt and ask yourself why the LLM could have generated this broken reply.\n\nIn most cases, you will realize that the LLM did not see the necessary information to answer. This information was expected to be in the prompt but is missing. When you understand which block was missing in the ConvoAgent prompt, you can find a way to ensure it gets added to the prompt to provide the correct response.\n\nWhat information blocks are present in the ConvoAgent prompt?\n\n1.  **Static blocks** (which are present at all steps of any workflow):\n\n*   Agent Persona and Roles\n*   Agent Main Instruction\n*   Business Context\n*   Explicit Constraints\n\n2.  **Workflow step blocks** (these change at each workflow step):\n\n*   Task Object\n*   Task Object Format\n*   Task Instruction\n*   Task Context (which is the Task Object received from the preceding workflow step)\n\n3.  **System dynamic blocks**:\n\n*   Memory (Agent-User conversation history with agent “thoughts”)\n*   Supervisor Agent missing info comments\n\n**Erroneous Answer:** At the very beginning of the conversation, the Agent, when asked about the availability of a vegetarian burger on the menu, answered, “I’m not sure.” Although there is a vegetarian burger on the menu.\n\n**Prompt Analysis Showed:** At the moment of answering “I’m not sure,” the agent had not yet started executing the first step of the “food\\_ordering” workflow. At the very beginning of the conversation, ConvoAgent only observed the static blocks and system dynamic blocks but did not observe the workflow step blocks. The menu is the Task Context of the first step of the “food\\_ordering” workflow.\n\n**The Fix:** We included a brief overview of the dishes in the Business Context section. This greatly improved the responses at times when the detailed menu was not being reviewed.\n\n**Erroneous Answer:** When asked if you have any free floating tank slots for tomorrow, the Spa Agent gave the answer, “We don’t have any free slots for tomorrow.” Although, in reality, there were slots available.\n\n**Prompt Analysis Showed:** At the moment of the answer, the agent was at the third step of the “book\\_workflow.” At this stage, it was supposed to review the list of free slots as the Task Context, which it should have received from the previous (second) step of the workflow.\n\nHowever, the Task Context showed free slots that did not correspond to reality. Where does the Task Context of the current step come from? It is the Task Object of the previous step. Who performed the previous (second) step? MagicWorker. This means we need to look at how the task for MagicWorker was set.\n\nThe analysis showed that MagicWorker received a task from ConvoAgent (from the first step of the workflow) where an incorrect date was specified. Then, it became clear that when creating the Spa account, the time zone was mistakenly specified, which led to the fact that at borderline moments, the word “tomorrow” generated the output of an erroneous date.\n\n**The Fix:** We corrected the time zone of the business.\n\nIf an LLM generates an incorrect or strange response, it most often means that the necessary information was not in the prompt. Study the prompt and understand what was missing. Once you understand this, decide in which of the ConvoAgent prompt information blocks this information should have been. Change the static blocks or workflow task objects or task instructions and make sure the problem is resolved.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

	"markdown": "# Google Places Picker Widget\n\nThe Google Places Picker widget allows users to enter a location and get redirected to the Newo.ai Agent Creator. This makes it easy for businesses to integrate the Agent Creator on their website while maintaining their branding. Here's an example of the Google Places Picker widget on the Newo.ai website:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/c3a4cce47d4b69ed6416dfaa8423efdfb96a4af7013660722196b909e20812da-Screenshot_2024-11-27_at_17.11.01.png)\n\nBelow is an example implementation using '@googlemaps/extended-component-library' and an explanation of how to construct the redirect URL to the Newo.ai Agent Creator in various scenarios.\n\n1.  Set up the Google Maps API by first creating a Google Cloud Platform project:\n    1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n    2.  Create a new project or select an existing one.\n    3.  Navigate to \"API & Services\" and then the \"Library\" section.\n    4.  Enable the \"Maps JavaScript API\" and \"Places API\" for your project.\n    5.  Obtain an API Key by going to \"API & Services\" and then the \"Credentials\" section. Click **Create Credentials** and **API Key**. It is recommended that your API key be restricted to avoid unauthorized usage.\n2.  Add the \"@googlemaps/extended-component-library\" to the `<head>` of your HTML site:\n\n```\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"https://unpkg.com/@googlemaps/extended-component-library\"></script>\n```\n\n3.  Place an API Loader element in the root of your app's HTML, specifying your API Key:\n\n```\n<gmpx-api-loader key=\"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\"></gmpx-api-loader>\n```\n\n4.  Place the [PlacePicker](https://github.com/googlemaps/extended-component-library/blob/HEAD/src/place_picker/README.md) component below the API loader to allow users to select a location:\n\n```\n<gmpx-place-picker placeholder=\"Enter a place\"></gmpx-place-picker>\n```\n\n5.  Style the Picker by adding CSS components and adjusting the values. For example:\n\n```\n.wrapper {\n    display: flex;\n    align-items: stretch;\n    gap: 0.5rem;\n}\n.input {\n    flex: 1;\n}\n.link {\n    display: inline-flex;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n    padding: 0.5rem 2rem;\n    background-color: #007bff;\n    color: white;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    border-radius: 0.25em;\n}\n```\n\nWhen a user selects a location, you can redirect them to the Newo.ai Agent Creator using the following link format:\n\n```\nhttps://agent.newo.ai/creator?source=${picker.value.googleMapsURI}&source_type=google_map\n```\n\nYou can optionally include a referral parameter, allowing you to track referrals for your agents:\n\n```\nhttps://agent.newo.ai/creator?source=${websiteUrl}&source_type=website&[email protected]\n```\n\nBelow is a complete HTML example that (1) sets up the Places Picker, (2) captures the selected place, and (3) constructs the recommended redirect URL to the Newo.ai Agent Creator.\n\n```\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n <title>Places API example</title>\n <script type=\"module\" src=\"https://unpkg.com/@googlemaps/extended-component-library\"></script>\n <style>\n   .wrapper {\n     display: flex;\n     align-items: stretch;\n     gap: 0.5rem;\n   }\n   .input {\n     flex: 1;\n   }\n   .link {\n     display: inline-flex;\n     justify-content: center;\n     align-items: center;\n     padding: 0.5rem 2rem;\n     background-color: #007bff;\n     color: white;\n     text-decoration: none;\n     border-radius: 0.25em;\n   }\n </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n<gmpx-api-loader key=\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"></gmpx-api-loader>\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n <gmpx-place-picker placeholder=\"Enter a place\" id=\"place-picker\" class=\"input\"></gmpx-place-picker>\n <a class=\"link\" href=\"\" id=\"link\">Go To Creator</a>\n</div>\n<script>\n const picker = document.getElementById('place-picker');\n const link = document.getElementById('link');\n link.addEventListener('click', (event) => {\n   if (!picker.value) {\n     event.preventDefault();\n     return false;\n   }\n   const redirectUrl = `https://agent.newo.ai/creator?source=${googleMapsURI}&source_type=google_map`;\n });\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

Here are just two scenarios where this action could come in useful:\n\n*   **Logging or Display Purposes:** Stripping quotes could be for aesthetic reasons, which is particularly useful when wanting to display data in an email or SMS where seeing extra quotes might be confusing or undesirable.\n*   **Data Cleanup:** In some cases, it may be necessary to clean or normalize string data, removing any enclosing quotes to avoid interfering with further data processing or comparisons.\n\n```\nStringify(\n  str\n)\n```\n\n### \n\nExample 1 (Basic)\n\n[](#example-1-basic)\n\nThe example below uses the Stringify action to remove quotes from a string. The result is sent to the Sandbox chat.\n\nSkill ScriptResponse\n\n```\n{{set(name=\"output\", value=Stringify(\"This is a basic test\"))}}\n\n{{SendMessage(message=output)}}\n```\n\n```\nThis is a basic test\n```\n\n### \n\nExample 2 (JSON)\n\n[](#example-2-json)\n\nThe example below shows the functionality of the Stringify action with a JSON value.

	"markdown": "# GetMemory\n\nReturns a list of actions (including but not limited to the messages). Currently, it only returns actions that have reference\\_idn: user\\_message and agent\\_message.\n\n```\nGetMemory(\n  fromPerson: Literal[\"User\", \"Agent\", \"Both\"],\n  offset: str,\n  count: str,\n  maxLen: str,\n  asEnglishText: str,\n  summarize: str,\n  fromDate: str,\n  toDate: str,\n  filterByActorIds: str,\n  filterByUserPersonaIds: str\n)\n```\n\n*   **fromPerson:** Indicates what persona the memory should be sourced from.\n*   **offset:** Offsets where the start of the pulled memory begins. In other words, offset is used when wanting to skip a certain number of the latest dialogue turns.\n*   **count:** The number of conversational turns.\n*   **maxLen:** The maximum number of characters.\n*   **asEnglishText:** Converts any foreign language text into English. Set \"true\" to activate. The default is \"false.\"\n*   **summarize:** Summarizes the memory. Set \"true\" to activate. The default is \"false.\"\n*   **fromDate:** Filters start of turns and accepts ISO-8601 format.\n*   **toDate:** Filters end of turns and accepts ISO-8601 format.\n*   **filterByActorIds:** Filters the memory based on Actor IDs and shows only that memory.\n*   **filterByUserPersonaIds:** Filters the memory based on Persona IDs and shows only that memory.\n\nIf filterByActorIds is set, the context user\\_persona\\_id and filterByUserPersonaIds parameters are ignored. If the filterByUserPersonaIds parameter is set, the context user\\_persona\\_id parameter is ignored.\n\nThis example uses the GetMemory command to send historical conversations to an LLM to provide a response. It allows for general conversations with your agent. Adjust the GetMemory parameters according to your needs.\n\n```\n{{#system~}}\n{{#block(hidden=True)}}\n{{set(name=\"agent\", value=GetAgent())}}\n{{set(name=\"user_\", value=GetUser())}}\n{{set(name=\"memory\", value=GetMemory(count=40, maxLen=20000))}}\n{{/block}}\n\nAGENT-USER MEMORY\n{{memory}}\n{{agent}}:\n{{~/system}}\n\n{{#assistant~}}\n{{gen(name=\"RESULT\", temperature=0.75)}}\n{{~/assistant}}\n```\n\n```\nUser: How are you?  \nAgent: I'm fine!  \nUser: Tell me about yourself.  \n```\n\n```\nAgent: I'm an AI assistant.\n```\n\nThis example gets the memory and translates any foreign language text into English. This was tested by sending the foreign language (Afrikaans) message, \"Hello hoe gaan dit?\"\n\n```\n{{set(name=\"memory\", value=GetMemory(count=\"10\",maxLen=\"2000\",asEnglishText=\"True\"))}}  \n\n{{SendMessage(message=memory)}} \n```\n\n```\nUser: Hello hoe gaan dit?\n```\n\n```\nUser: Hello hoe gaan dit?\nUser: Hello how are you?\n```\n\nIf you need to skip a certain number of the latest dialogue instances, use the offset parameter.\n\n```\n{{set(name=\"memory\", value=GetMemory(offset=\"2\",count=\"10\",maxLen=\"2000\"))}}  \n\n{{SendMessage(message=memory)}}\n```\n\n```\nUser: How are you?  \nAgent: I'm fine!  \nUser: Tell me about yourself.  \nAgent: I'm an AI assistant.\n```\n\n```\nUser: How are you?  \nAgent: I'm fine! \n```\n\nIn an instance where you are dealing with multiple actors/personas, you may want to filter the memory based on their IDs. The example below creates two new personas and actors and sends various messages. The Sandbox chat message is then the filtered result showing one of the actor ID messages. This illustrates the filtering capabilities. The below example can be done by targeting the persona IDs as well instead of the actor IDs.\n\n```\n{{set(name=\"persona_id_one\", value=CreatePersona(name=\"Martin\"))}}\n{{set(\n   name=\"actor_id_one\",\n   value=CreateActor(\n       integrationIdn=\"sandbox\",\n       connectorIdn=\"connector_one\",\n       externalId=\"1234567890\",\n       personaId=persona_id_one,\n       timeZone=\"America/Los_Angeles\"\n   )\n)}}\n\n{{SendMessage(message=\"Martin's message 1\", actorIds=actor_id_one)}}\n{{SendMessage(message=\"Martin's message 2\", actorIds=actor_id_one)}}\n{{SendMessage(message=\"Martin's message 3\", actorIds=actor_id_one)}}\n{{SendMessage(message=\"Martin's message 4\", actorIds=actor_id_one)}}\n\n\n{{set(name=\"persona_id_two\", value=CreatePersona(name=\"Lauren\"))}}\n{{set(\n   name=\"actor_id_two\",\n   value=CreateActor(\n       integrationIdn=\"sandbox\",\n       connectorIdn=\"connector_two\",\n       externalId=\"1234567890\",\n       personaId=persona_id_two,\n       timeZone=\"America/Los_Angeles\"\n   )\n)}}\n\n{{SendMessage(message=\"Lauren's message 1\", actorIds=actor_id_two)}}\n{{SendMessage(message=\"Lauren's message 2\", actorIds=actor_id_two)}}\n{{SendMessage(message=\"Lauren's message 3\", actorIds=actor_id_two)}}\n{{SendMessage(message=\"Lauren's message 4\", actorIds=actor_id_two)}}\n\n{{set(name=\"memory\", value=GetMemory(filterByActorIds=actor_id_two))}}\n{{SendMessage(message=memory)}}\n```\n\n```\nAgent: Lauren's message 1\nAgent: Lauren's message 2\nAgent: Lauren's message 3\nAgent: Lauren's message 4\n```\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

Your phone rings twice (≈ 10 seconds).\n2.  If unanswered, the call is automatically forwarded to an AI Agent.\n3.  The AI Agent answers on the third ring and handles the caller.\n\n### \n\nBefore You Start\n\n[](#before-you-start)\n\n| Requirement | Why it matters |\n| --- | --- |\n| AI Agent number | Used in all forwarding scenarios. |\n| A mobile plan that supports call-forwarding codes | Most carriers allow these commands. |\n\n### \n\nGSM Networks (T-Mobile, AT&T, Mint, US Mobile, Google Fi, etc.)\n\n[](#gsm-networks-t-mobile-att-mint-us-mobile-google-fi-etc)\n\n| Action | Dial Code | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| To active delayed forwarding (\\*10 sec) | `**61*ASSISTANT_NUMBER**10#` → Press Call | `**61*+15551234567**10#` → Press Call |\n| To disable delayed forwarding | `##61#` → Press Call | N/A |\n| To check the current status | `*#61#` → Press Call | N/A |\n| To reset all forwarding settings | `##002#` → Press Call | N/A |\n\n> \\***Valid delay options: 5, 10, 15 seconds**\n\n### \n\nVerizon (CDMA Network)\n\n[](#verizon-cdma-network)\n\n> Verizon does **not** support delayed forwarding via dial codes.

Sign in to your **My Verizon** account.\n2.  Navigate to **Call Forwarding**.\n3.  Set up forwarding to the AI Agent number if there is no answer after 10 seconds or call Verizon at **+1 (800) 922-0204** for support.\n\n### \n\nTesting Your Setup\n\n[](#testing-your-setup)\n\n1.  Use another phone to call your number.\n2.  Let it ring twice.\n3.  Confirm that the third ring is answered by your AI Agent.\n\nIf your AI Agent does not answer, verify that:\n\n*   The correct **AI Agent number** was entered.\n*   The delay is set to **10 s** (or your chosen interval).\n*   Forwarding is still active (`*#61#` for GSM).\n\n### \n\nTroubleshooting\n\n[](#troubleshooting)\n\n| Symptom | Possible Cause | Fix |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Calls never forward | Forwarding not activated | Redial the code. |\n| Forwarding is instant (no rings) | Immediate forwarding code used | Cancel (`##61#` or `*73` depending on your network), then set delayed forwarding. |\n| \"Connection problem or invalid MMI code\" message | Carrier does not support dial code | Configure forwarding in the carrier's app or web portal. |\n\nUpdated 3 months ago\n\n* * *"

	"markdown": "# Instant Callback Agent\n\nThe Instant Callback functionality enables your AI Agent to perform immediate outreach to users who have just submitted a form on your website. This allows for real-time engagement by automatically contacting users via SMS, email, phone calls, or scheduling meetings based on their form inputs.\n\nWhen a user submits a form on your website, an HTTP POST request is triggered (set up on your website backend). This request contains a pre-configured webhook URL with a JSON payload containing the requested action in an `external_request` field. The AI Agent then initiates the appropriate communication channel without delay.\n\nYou can implement Instant Callback using a simple HTML form where the user's contact information is dynamically inserted into the request:\n\n```\n<form action=\"https://your-webhook-url.com\" method=\"POST\">\n  <div>\n    <label for=\"name\">Your Name:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <label for=\"phone\">Phone Number:</label>\n    <input type=\"tel\" id=\"phone\" name=\"phone\" required>\n  </div>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" id=\"externalRequest\" name=\"external_request\">\n  <button type=\"submit\" onclick=\"setRequestValue()\">Submit</button>\n  \n  <script>\n    function setRequestValue() {\n      const phone = document.getElementById('phone').value;\n      const name = document.getElementById('name').value;\n      document.getElementById('externalRequest').value = \n        `Send an SMS with the following content: Hi ${name}! I'm Adrian, an AI consultant from Newo. Congratulations on your submission!. To the phone number: ${phone}`;\n    }\n  </script>\n</form>\n```\n\nFor more control over JSON payloads, use JavaScript to handle the form submission:\n\n```\n<script>\n  document.getElementById('callbackForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    \n    // Get the user's input values from the form\n    const formData = new FormData(this);\n    const phone = formData.get('phone');\n    const email = formData.get('email');\n    const name = formData.get('name');\n    \n    // Construct the external_request with the dynamic user data\n    fetch('https://your-webhook-url.com', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        external_request: \\`Send an SMS with the following content: Hi ${name}! I'm Adrian, an AI consultant from Newo. Congratulations on your submission!. To the phone number: ${phone}\\`\n      })\n    });\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nUse this command to have your AI Agent send text messages to users immediately after form submission. The phone number is dynamically filled from the form input:\n\n```\n{  \n  \"external_request\": \"Send an SMS with the following content: Hi! I'm Adrian, an AI consultant from Newo. Congratulations, you've just created your AI Employee! To complete the setup, you'll need to meet with my human colleague. Would tomorrow be convenient for you?. To the phone number: ${phoneNumber}\"  \n}\n```\n\nUse this command to have your AI Agent send emails to users instantly. The email address is dynamically filled from the form input:\n\n```\n{  \n  \"external_request\": \"Send an email with the following content: Hi! I'm Adrian, an AI consultant from Newo. Congratulations, you've just created your AI Employee!. To the ${userEmail}\"  \n}\n```\n\nUse this command to have your AI Agent call users directly after they submit the form. The phone number is dynamically filled from the form input:\n\n```\n{  \n  \"external_request\": \"Call the user to know how they are doing using this phone number: ${phoneNumber}\"  \n}\n```\n\nUse this command to have your AI Agent schedule meetings with users automatically. The email address is dynamically filled from the form input:\n\n```\n{  \n  \"external_request\": \"Create a meeting with the user on 04.03.2025 at 2 pm using their email ${userEmail}\"  \n}\n```\n\nMake an HTTP request to your webhook URL with the following specifications:\n\n*   Method: POST\n*   URL: Your configured webhook URL (ask the Newo team for your unique webhook)\n*   Headers:\n    *   Content-Type: application/json\n    *   Body: One of the JSON objects containing the `external_request` field with dynamic values from your form\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

	"markdown": "# Waiting Response Timers\n\nA timer integrated into your agents behavior is important to be able to respond to instances when a user may have forgotten to reply and a friendly prompt is needed. Alternatively, a timer could be used to provide updates to a user if the agent needs time to respond.\n\n**Goal:** Add two follow-up timers to prompt a user to reply. This is a basic integration, and will be expanded on in more advanced agents.\n\n> 📘\n\nFor this agent, to remove any complexity, start with a basic agent, as set up for the “Hello World” example. You should have a Sandbox chat event and one main Skill.\n\nA Skill needs to be created for each of the two follow-up timers that will be set up. For the “Skill Idn” and “Skill title” for the first new Skill, use “FollowupFirstSkill.” For the second new Skill, use “FollowupSecondSkill.”\n\nFor each timer instance with defined parameters, a timer connector is required.\n\n1.  To create a new Timer connector, navigate to the Integrations page from the left-side panel.\n2.  Click the **plus** icon on the “Timer Integration (Programmable)” item.\n3.  Add a “Title” and “Idn.” In this case, just call the title and idn “follow\\_up\\_first.”\n4.  Click **Save**.\n5.  Repeat steps 2 to 4, except use “follow\\_up\\_second” for the “Title” and “Idn.”\n\nIn order for the newly created timer Skill to be activated, the Skill needs to be subscribed to an event, which will be triggered when the main Skill is triggered by sending a message in the Sandbox chat.\n\n1.  Click the **plus** icon next to the Event Subscription section on the left-side panel.\n2.  Under the “Event Idn,” select “timer” from the dropdown.\n3.  Under “Integration,” select “program\\_timer” from the dropdown.\n4.  Under “Connector,” select “follow\\_up\\_first\\_skill” from the dropdown.\n5.  Under “Skill selector,” select “skill\\_idn” from the dropdown.\n6.  Under “Skill name,” select “FollowupFirstSkill” from the dropdown.\n7.  Add an “Event description.” This field is optional but will help in the future when identifying the purpose of an event from a complex flow containing multiple event subscriptions.\n8.  Click **Create** to save the event.\n9.  Repeat steps 1 to 8 but for the second follow-up Skill and connector.\n\nReplace everything in the main Skill with the following Skill Script:\n\n```\n{{SendMessage(message='MainSkill triggered', actorIds=GetActors(integrationIdn=\"sandbox\", connectorIdn=\"connector\", personaId=GetUser(field=\"id\")))}}\n\n{{SendCommand(commandIdn=\"set_timer\", integrationIdn=\"program_timer\", connectorIdn=\"follow_up_first\", persona_id=GetUser(field=\"id\"), timer_name=\"AnyName1\", interval=\"5\", repeatable=\"false\", enabled=\"true\")}}\n\n{{SendCommand(commandIdn=\"set_timer\", integrationIdn=\"program_timer\", connectorIdn=\"follow_up_second\", persona_id=GetUser(field=\"id\"), timer_name=\"AnyName2\", interval=\"10\", repeatable=\"false\", enabled=\"true\")}}\n```\n\nAdd the following to the “FollowupFirstSkill.”\n\n```\n{{SendMessage(message=\"Are you still there?\", actorIds=GetActors(integrationIdn=\"sandbox\", connectorIdn=\"connector\", personaId=GetUser(field=\"id\")))}}\n```\n\nAdd the following to the “FollowupSecondSkill.”\n\n```\n{{SendMessage(message=\"Hellooooo?\", actorIds=GetActors(integrationIdn=\"sandbox\", connectorIdn=\"connector\", personaId=GetUser(field=\"id\")))}}\n```\n\n1.  Click **Save and Publish** in the top-right corner of the Flow Builder.\n2.  Type anything in the Sandbox chat field, and click the **send** icon.\n\nThe response will be a message saying “MainSkill triggered,” followed by a 5 second delay, another message saying “Are you still there?” followed by a 5 second delay, and another message saying “Hellooooo?”\n\nThis example used short interval timers to illustrate the functionality. However, you will need to adjust the timer intervals within the main Skill to something longer. The interval parameters are in seconds. Since the timers are all activated at the same time within the main Skill, ensure the intervals are stepped (i.e., timer 2 should be longer than timer 1).\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

	"markdown": "# Talking Head (Web Chat) Integration\n\nYou’ve likely seen a chatbot on a website before (usually located at the bottom-right corner). The Talking Head integration is a step ahead in that you are able to have either a text-only web chat or enable a talking head for a more humanized conversation with a Digital Employee.\n\nWhen communicating with the Talking Head, you can type your messages or click the microphone icon to speak to your Newo Digital Employee. The Talking Head integration uses the OpenAI API to convert your speech to text. For this to work, you need an OpenAI API key to use the Talking Head integration. Not sure where to find that? Here’s a [quick guide](https://docs.newo.ai/docs/openai-api-keys). Once you have the API key, follow the steps below within the Newo platform:\n\n1.  Navigate to the Integrations page from the left-side panel.\n2.  Click the **gear** icon on the \"Talking Head\" item.\n3.  Add your \"OpenAI API Key.\"\n4.  Click **Save**.\n\nYou will need to specify a HeyGen API key to enable the Talking Head functionality. Here’s how to get one:\n\n1.  Navigate to the [HeyGen website](https://heygen.ai/).\n2.  Log in to your account, or sign up for a new one if you don't have one yet.\n3.  Once you’ve logged in, navigate to the [API keys page](https://heygen.ai/account/api-keys), where you will find your API key.\n\n1.  Click the **plus** icon on the \"Talking Head\" item.\n2.  Add a \"Title\" and \"Idn.\" For example, \"th\\_connector.\"\n3.  Optional: Add a \"Greeting Phrase.\" Although, this is recommended to welcome the user and provide some instructions on how to use the Talking Head. For example, \"Hello, what can I assist you with today?\"\n4.  Toggle \"Disable\" to have the chat work only in text mode or \"Enable\" to have Talking Head functionality.\n5.  For the \"Auto Open After\" value, you can specify a time in seconds, after which the Talking Head will be opened automatically. Enter either:\n    1.  **\\-1** = will never open automatically\n    2.  **0** = will open immediately\n    3.  **0** >= will open after N seconds. For example, adding \"3\" would open the Talking Head after 3 seconds.\n6.  Add your HeyGen API key if you require the Talking Head functionality; otherwise, leave it empty.\n7.  Specify the Voice ID that will be used for the Talking Head. You can find the list of available voices on the [HeyGen website](https://heygen.ai/).\n8.  Leave the \"Widget Script\" empty, as it will be generated automatically after running the connector. You will need this script to add the Talking Head to your website.\n9.  Specify the Heygen Avatar that will be used for the Talking Head. You can find the list of available Avatars on the [HeyGen website](https://heygen.ai/).\n10.  Leave the \"Client Secret\" empty, as it will be generated automatically after running the connector. The \"Client Secret\" is a key that is used to authenticate the Talking Head widget with the Talking Head backend.\n11.  For the \"Client Website Base URL,\" you’d want to first set up a demo environment, which you can do by entering the domain where you’ll have the Talking Head, but with some slight modifications.\n    1.  Let’s say you want the Talking Head web chat to work on \"[https://newo.ai](https://newo.ai/)\".\n    2.  Add a \"-\" where there is a \".\" which, in this case, would be \"https://newo-ai\".\n    3.  Then add \".webchat.newo.ai\" to the end.\n    4.  The final \"Client Website Base URL\" would be \"[https://newo-ai.webchat.newo.ai](https://newo-ai.webchat.newo.ai/)\".\n12.  Add a \"Color\" in HEX (e.g., #FFFFFF), which is the color of the Talking Head icon that will be on your website.\n13.  Add an \"Agent Name,\" which will be displayed at the top of the web chat window.\n14.  Add an \"Agent Picture URL\" or leave it empty for the default picture. This picture is used to identify the Digital Employee the user is communicating with.\n15.  Click **Save**.\n\nOnce a connector is created, you will need to click the Run button to enable the connector, which will also generate the \"Widget Script\" and \"Client Secret\" when you open the settings of the connector again.\n\nTesting and debugging are an essential part of the process of creating a Digital Employee. You can test the conversational skills within the Sandbox chat. However, you may want to see how the Talking Head appears on your website without making it live. This is where a demo website comes in handy.\n\n1.  Click the **three dots** icon on the right of the created connector.\n2.  Click **Edit Settings**.\n3.  Copy the \"Client Website Base URL\" and paste it into a new browser window/tab with the following additions:\n    1.  Add \"/?client=\" to the end.\n    2.  Copy the generated \"Client Secret\" and paste it at the end (e.g., \"[https://newo-ai.webchat.newo.ai/?client=09aec2b1-7122-4570-8538-2b4f0cb5051f\"](https://newo-ai.webchat.newo.ai/?client=09aec2b1-7122-4570-8538-2b4f0cb5051f%22).\n4.  The URL you entered will open your website with the Talking Head chat icon at the bottom-right corner. You can now test out the functionality in this demo environment before going live.\n\n1.  Click the **three dots** icon on the right of the created connector.\n2.  Click **Edit Settings**.\n3.  Change the “Client Website Base URL” to your website URL without the modifications made for the demo (e.g., [www.newo.ai](http://www.newo.ai/)).\n4.  Copy the generated “Widget Script” to your clipboard and add it to your website's HTML code right before the end of the body tag.\n5.  Ensure you **Save** the updated connector.\n6.  Publish your website and ensure the Talking Head icon appears at the bottom-right corner of your website.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"

Click the **plus** icon on the \"Vapi Integration\" item.\n2.  Fill in the connector \"Title,\" \"Idn\" (identifying name), and a custom \"Greeting Phrase\" for when an agent first speaks to a user. It is advisable to use the format vapi\\_\\[phone number\\] for the \"Title\" and \"Idn\" to easily see the number being used for a particular connector. For example, vapi\\_6592272513. You can view the generated phone number by opening the Vapi connector settings again after you click **Save**.\n3.  Add a \"Disclaimer Phrase.\" The default phrase is \"Absolutely. Please note that I am logging our conversation, allow me a couple of seconds of delay in my responses.\" This phrase is stated after the Greeting Phrase and after a user says something.\n4.  Select the \"Agent\" you want to answer the phone. In this case, you can use an existing agent from past examples (e.g., \"Embedded Instructions\" or \"Embedded Context\" agents). If you’re using the Superagent framework, select the ConvoAgent.\n5.  In the \"Phone Area Code\" field, type any US area code to select the area where your phone number should be registered.\n6.  Specify the code of the \"Language\" you want your agent to speak. Use \"en-US\" for English.\n7.  Set the \"Enable the end-of-call report\" value to \"true\" if you want the Vapi integration to send you \"call\\_ended\" and \"call\\_aborted\" events.\n8.  Copy and paste a \"Voice Provider\" and \"Voice Id\" from the supported list below:\n    1.

Lower values (e.g., `0.5`) restrict vocabulary; `1` allows full diversity. Unlike `temperature`, `topP` focuses on probability mass rather than randomness.\n*   **skipFilter:** (Optional) Skips content moderation filters.

This is ideal for dynamic scenarios where immediate feedback or live updates are necessary. The action supports advanced interruption modes to handle changing requirements mid-stream.\n\n`GenStream(   interruptMode: Literal[\"interruptWindow\", \"interrupt\", \"none\"] = \"interrupt\",     interruptWindow: float = None,     sendTo: Literal[\"actors\", \"currentActor\", \"latestMessageActor\"] = \"currentActor\",     actorIds: list[str] = None,     temperature: float = 0.75,     stop: list[str] = None,     maxTokens: int = None,     topP: float = 1.0,     skipFilter: bool = False,     skipChecks: bool = False,     maxRetries: int = 5 )`\n\n#### \n\nWhere:\n\n[](#where)\n\n*   **interruptMode:** Various modes to change how message generation handles interruptions.\n    *   **interrupt:** The generation process will be immediately interrupted if a new event occurs. This is useful when prioritizing new events over ongoing message generation.\n    *   **interruptWindow:** Enables the interruptWindow setting.\n    *   **none:** The generation process will not be interrupted, regardless of new incoming events. The message will be generated fully before handling any new events.\n*   **interruptWindow:** Specifies a time window (in seconds) during which an interruption can occur. If an interrupting event happens within this window, the generation is stopped. If no events occur within the window, the message completes uninterrupted.\n*   **sendTo:** Specify where to send the generated response.\n    *   **actors:** Sends the generated message to a specific list of actors. This requires providing the actorIds parameter to identify the recipients.\n    *   **currentActor:** Sends the response back to the actor that triggered the current event. This is the default option and is typically used in one-to-one interactions.\n    *   **latestMessageActor:** Sends the generated output to the actor involved in the most recent message interaction. This ensures continuity, especially when the current context has shifted to a different actor.\n*   **actorIds:** A list of actor IDNs to which to send the generated message.\n*   **temperature:** (Optional) Controls the randomness of the output (higher values produce more random outputs).\n*   **stop:** (Optional) Stops generation when specific sequences are detected. Defaults to agent names/usernames (e.g., `[\"Agent:\", \"User:\"]`) to prevent unwanted dialogue continuations. Customize to halt generation at markers like `\".\"` or `\"]\"` for JSON parsing.\n*   **maxTokens:** (Optional) The maximum number of tokens to generate (i.e., limiting the length of the response).\n*   **topP:** (Optional) Nucleus sampling value for output diversity. Lower values (e.g., `0.5`) restrict vocabulary; `1` allows full diversity. Unlike `temperature`, `topP` focuses on probability mass rather than randomness.\n*   **skipFilter:** (Optional) Skips content moderation filters. Enable for JSON outputs to preserve brackets/formatting. Disable for user-facing text to enforce safety checks.\n*   **skipChecks:** (Optional) Skips validation checks on input/output.\n*   **maxRetries:** The number of times to retry failed LLM requests. Addresses provider instability (e.g., OpenAI occasionally returning empty responses).\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *\n\nDid this page help you?\n\nYes\n\nNo"

	"markdown": "# Embedded Instructions\n\nIn most cases, you’d want your agent to go through a very specific process with a defined end goal. In the case of the receptionist agent, you’d want your goal to be for a user to book a room at the hotel. We call these instructions “workflow instructions.” Workflow instructions also contain “workflow steps,” which identify every step of the process you want your agent to follow.\n\n**Goal:** Inject workflow instructions into the Skill Script to allow the agent to work through specific instruction steps.\n\nUsing the same connector, skill, and event setup as with the “Hello World” example, copy the following code into the Skill Script.\n\n```\n{{#system~}}\n{{set(name='agent_', value=GetAgent())}}\n{{set(name='user_', value=GetUser())}}\n{{set(name='memory', value=GetMemory(count=40, maxLen=20000))}}\n\nBIOGRAPHY:\n\nYou are a receptionist Agent named {{agent_}} for the Hotel called “Carmel Ocean Inn,” talking to User named {{user_}}. \n\nYOUR INSTRUCTION: \n\nRead the AGENT-USER MEMORY and think which instruction step was not completed yet starting from the top. Reply according to the instruction step which were not completed. Move to the next instruction step only when you completed all previous instruction steps.\n\nInstruction step format: \n>>>instruction step description\n\nINSTRUCTION STEPS:\n \n>>>Greeting: Start with a warm and professional greeting.\n>>>Introduction: Introduce yourself and your role.\n>>>Understanding Client Needs: Ask about the client's requirements and preferences (hotel restaurant, type of room, location, budget, amenities, etc.).\n>>>Room Overview: Present a brief overview of available rooms that match their criteria.\n>>>Follow-Up Questions: Address any concerns or additional questions they may have.\n>>>Closing the Conversation: End with a summary of the discussed points and send a booking link for them to book the room (booking link: www.thisisabookinglink.com). Alternatively, if they wanted to just visit the restaurant, provide them with a number to phone the restaurant to book a table (Number: +271234567890).\n\nCONTEXT:\n\nCarmel Ocean Inn features individually decorated accommodations with free Wi-Fi. Carmel Beach is less than 1 mile away.\n\nA flat-screen cable TV is provided in each accommodation at Carmel Ocean Inn.  Accommodations include Amish-crafted furniture, private entrances, and private bathrooms.  Select accommodations offer fully equipped kitchens and gas fireplaces.\n\nPebble Beach Golf Club is 2 miles away from the property. Monterey Bay Aquarium is a 15-minute drive away. Big Sur is 40 minutes’ drive away.\n\nCouples in particular like the location – they rated it 9.3 for a two-person trip.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING ROOMS ARE AVAILABLE\n>>>Room Type\t\nGuadalupe Room, \n2 twin beds \n247 sq.feet Private BathroomFlat-screen TVCoffee machineFree WiFi\nFree toiletries Toilet Fireplace Bathtub or shower Towels Linens Sitting area Private entrance TV Refrigerator Telephone Ironing facilities Tea/Coffee maker Iron Heating Hairdryer Carpeted Cable channels Alarm clock Wardrobe or closet Upper floors accessible by stairs only Toilet paper Carbon monoxide detector\n\nNumber of guests\n2\n\nPrice for 1 night\t\nOriginal price US$292 \nCurrent price US$224\n+US$48 taxes and fees\nNon-refundable\n\n>>>Room Type\t\nScenic Room, 1 King\n1 king bed \n280 sq.feet Inner courtyard viewPrivate BathroomFlat-screen TVCoffee machineFree WiFi\nFree toiletries Toilet Fireplace Bathtub or shower Towels Linens Desk Sitting area Private entrance TV Refrigerator Telephone Ironing facilities Tea/Coffee maker Iron Heating Hairdryer Carpeted Cable channels Alarm clock Wardrobe or closet Upper floors accessible by stairs only Toilet paper Carbon monoxide detector\n\nNumber of guests\n2\n\nPrice for 1 night\t\nOriginal price US$378 \nCurrent price US$303\n+US$51 taxes and fees\nNon-refundable\n\nHotel restaurant is available for booking. There's a fine dining restaurant Fyn or a American restuarant named Sally’s. Both are inside the hotel.\n\n\nEXPLICIT CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- Reply in the language the User is speaking.\n- Don’t use emojis.\n- Verbosity level: Low verbosity (20 words or less) for a new Instruction step and high verbosity only if the User requests details, more information, or if you are conducting a deep_dive workflow.\n- When you write your reply, remember who made the last reply. If you were the last to respond, then write your reply taking into account your last answer (i.e., continue the thought).\n- If the user asks questions or makes statements not related to the instruction steps, ensure they are directed back to the conversation to complete the instruction steps. \n\n\nAGENT-USER MEMORY:\n\n{{memory}}\n{{agent_}}:\n\n{{~/system}}\n\n{{#assistant~}}\n\n{{gen(name='RESULT', temperature=0.75)}}\n\n{{~/assistant}}\n```\n\n> 🚧\n\nNote that the Skill Script is identical to the previous example, besides the addition of the instructions. The sections are now “BIOGRAPHY,” “INSTRUCTIONS,” “CONTEXT,” “EXPLICIT CONSTRAINTS,” and “USER-AGENT MEMORY.”\n\nThe instructions section encompasses “YOUR INSTRUCTION,” “INSTRUCTION STEP FORMAT,” and “INSTRUCTION STEPS.” Read each section to understand how the receptionist agent is being directed through a particular process.\n\n> 📘\n\nCreate a new user in the Sandbox chat to avoid confusing the LLM with past chat history from previous examples:\n\n1.  Click the **plus** icon next to the “User:” section in the Sandbox chat.\n2.  Add a “Name.” In this case, this is the name of a user who will be talking to the agent, which can be your name or a made-up name for testing purposes.\n3.  Click the checkbox if you'd like to create an actor for the user persona. An Actor is someone who communicates through a specific connector. For example, a specific user could communicate via the Sandbox chat (Sandbox chat connector) and over the phone (Twilio connector), which each have identifiers of separate actors. For this case, we are going to create a single actor for Sandbox chat communications (ensure the checkbox is ticked).\n4.  Under the \"Actor settings,\" select “sandbox” for the “Integration” and “connector” for the “Connector.”\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/8d5ecbd-Screenshot_2024-02-06_at_15.07.24.png)\n\n5.  Click **Create and apply** to save the user.\n\nClick **Save and Publish**, type “Hello” into the Sandbox chat, and click the **send** icon. The agent should now respond to you as if you’re conversing. Ask it about the available rooms and the cost of the room.\n\nYou can now have a full conversation with the agent and watch as it takes you through the instruction steps outlined in the Skill Script. The final result should lead you to a booking link or a phone number.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n* * *"
