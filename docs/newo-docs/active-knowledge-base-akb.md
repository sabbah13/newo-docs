# Active Knowledge Base (AKB)

Most Intelligent Agents require a large amount of data to function optimally and provide useful results to a user. Moreover, this data can be static or dynamic, adding build complexity to an agent. Moreover, sending all of this data each time a prompt is sent to an LLM is costly and inefficient.

The Newo AKB, a unique vector database, doesn't just store corporate documents and communication histories. It also retains scenarios and work instructions – hence its designation as an Active Knowledge Base.

By uploading job instructions to Newo AKB, you automatically revise the working scenarios of your digital employees, streamlining workflow adjustments without reprogramming.
