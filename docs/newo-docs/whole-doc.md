Welcome to the Newo.ai platform, where the creation of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) applications is at your fingertips. Our platform enables the rapid development of Digital Employees, which are more than mere programs – they are Digital Workers poised to undertake roles traditionally filled by human staff.

Newo Inc. is a creator of a low-code platform where integrators and businesses build “digital employees” - human-level AI agents. Distinct from AI agents created on conventional builders, Newo.ai’s “digital employees” are ready out of the box to communicate with clients, company employees, and managers through familiar human channels—phone, SMS, email, online chat, Instagram, and messengers.

They can also perform business actions like bookings, reservations, and appointment settings in browsers, CRMs, and ERPs, simulating mouse and keyboard actions. As a result, these digital employees do not require months of technical integration but can be “hired” within a few hours.

Newo.ai Agents are designed to be integral team members, working in tandem with human colleagues to enhance efficiency, ease the burden of urgent tasks, and foster a healthier work-life balance. They assume the brunt of repetitive and routine tasks, allowing your human team to devote more time to family, friends, and higher-level strategic and creative pursuits.

The cornerstone of Newo.ai Agents is the Newo Omnichannel Architecture (NOA) alongside the Newo Intelligent Flow (NIF) capabilities. These features facilitate seamless omnichannel communication, encompassing voice, email, messaging, and even an in-person-like presence.

They adeptly recognize individuals across different channels, consolidating communication histories and rationales. This is instrumental for building human-centric corporate AI applications that integrate smoothly with your existing workflows.

This documentation marks the beginning of your journey with Newo.ai Agents, providing a comprehensive walkthrough of the fundamental concepts and syntax you need to employ the full capabilities of AI in your business ventures. Let's embark on this transformative adventure together!
