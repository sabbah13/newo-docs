# Outbound Caller

The outbound caller functionality allows your AI agent to call cold/warm leads. This is particularly useful if you’d like to call leads in bulk quickly. Here are some standout features:

*   Call leads automatically during a pre-defined time or set working hours based on the time zone.
*   Detect voicemails and either drop the call or leave a voicemail.
*   Know why a call ended (customer ended the call, number does not exist, call failed, etc.).
*   Bulk call multiple numbers at once and set how many times the agent tries to phone before moving on.
*   Adjust custom instructions in plain text to alter the agent's behavior according to your calling scripts.
*   Book meetings automatically after a user provides their contact information.
*   Send an SMS or email to a user after the phone call to provide additional information, a summary of the call, or a link to a product/services page—it is up to you!
*   Collect user details based on pre-defined questions.
*   Automatically populate session logs containing call details.

> 
> Starting December 1, 2024, due to security, anti-spam, and privacy requirements, new rules will apply to AI Agents making outbound calls. AI Agents created on the Newo.ai platform "out of the box" using Twilio integration provided by Newo.ai will be limited to **10 outbound calls per day per agent**. Additionally, outbound calls will be restricted to "low-risk" countries as defined by the Twilio system.
> 
> If you require a higher volume of outbound calls or need to make calls to countries with a different risk classification, we kindly ask you to register on the Twilio platform, purchase phone numbers there, and provide them to us for integration into the Newo.ai platform.
> 
> Please note that these rules apply only to outbound calls and do not affect inbound calls, which remain unrestricted in both volume and territory.
