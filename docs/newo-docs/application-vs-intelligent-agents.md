# Application vs Intelligent Agents

In order for the Intelligent Agent to communicate with your corporate users or clients, you will need some other user-facing interface in the form of a mobile application or website. We refer to the term “Application,” which encompasses a set of technologies that includes two concepts:

1.  Intelligent Agent
2.  User-facing UX/UI that interact with each other through the Newo API

We use the term Intelligent Agent to designate the server part that receives messages from the mobile/web UX, receives signals from the outside world, and generates a response to the mobile/web UX and other commands to control the outside world.

Our documentation will describe the development of the Intelligent Agent and will almost not touch on the development of client-side, user-facing UX/UI.
