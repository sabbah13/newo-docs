# Embedded Instructions

In most cases, you’d want your agent to go through a very specific process with a defined end goal. In the case of the receptionist agent, you’d want your goal to be for a user to book a room at the hotel. We call these instructions “workflow instructions.” Workflow instructions also contain “workflow steps,” which identify every step of the process you want your agent to follow.

**Goal:** Inject workflow instructions into the Skill Script to allow the agent to work through specific instruction steps.

Using the same connector, skill, and event setup as with the “Hello World” example, copy the following code into the Skill Script.

```
{{#system~}}
{{set(name='agent_', value=GetAgent())}}
{{set(name='user_', value=GetUser())}}
{{set(name='memory', value=GetMemory(count=40, maxLen=20000))}}

EXPLICIT CONSTRAINTS:

- Reply in the language the User is speaking.
- Don’t use emojis.
- Verbosity level: Low verbosity (20 words or less) for a new Instruction step and high verbosity only if the User requests details, more information, or if you are conducting a deep_dive workflow.
- When you write your reply, remember who made the last reply. If you were the last to respond, then write your reply taking into account your last answer (i.e., continue the thought).
- If the user asks questions or makes statements not related to the instruction steps, ensure they are directed back to the conversation to complete the instruction steps. 


AGENT-USER MEMORY:

{{memory}}
{{agent_}}:

{{~/system}}

{{#assistant~}}

{{gen(name='RESULT', temperature=0.75)}}

{{~/assistant}}

> 🚧

Note that the Skill Script is identical to the previous example, besides the addition of the instructions. The sections are now “BIOGRAPHY,” “INSTRUCTIONS,” “CONTEXT,” “EXPLICIT CONSTRAINTS,” and “USER-AGENT MEMORY.”

The instructions section encompasses “YOUR INSTRUCTION,” “INSTRUCTION STEP FORMAT,” and “INSTRUCTION STEPS.” Read each section to understand how the receptionist agent is being directed through a particular process.

Create a new user in the Sandbox chat to avoid confusing the LLM with past chat history from previous examples:

1.  Click the **plus** icon next to the “User:” section in the Sandbox chat.
2.  Add a “Name.” In this case, this is the name of a user who will be talking to the agent, which can be your name or a made-up name for testing purposes.
3.  Click the checkbox if you'd like to create an actor for the user persona. An Actor is someone who communicates through a specific connector. For example, a specific user could communicate via the Sandbox chat (Sandbox chat connector) and over the phone (Twilio connector), which each have identifiers of separate actors. For this case, we are going to create a single actor for Sandbox chat communications (ensure the checkbox is ticked).
4.  Under the "Actor settings," select “sandbox” for the “Integration” and “connector” for the “Connector.”

5.  Click **Create and apply** to save the user.

Click **Save and Publish**, type “Hello” into the Sandbox chat, and click the **send** icon. The agent should now respond to you as if you’re conversing. Ask it about the available rooms and the cost of the room.

You can now have a full conversation with the agent and watch as it takes you through the instruction steps outlined in the Skill Script. The final result should lead you to a booking link or a phone number.
