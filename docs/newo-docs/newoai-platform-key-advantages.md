![](https://files.readme.io/39b05af-_14020d5c-38f3-4a80-89a9-5552ff0010dc.jpeg)

The Newo.ai platform's suite of features offers transformative advantages, such as:

*   **No-code rapid agent deployment:** Simple agents, such as those for sales or technical support, can be created in a remarkably short time frame — as little as 10-30 minutes — without requiring any coding expertise. This speed facilitates immediate integration into your business processes.
*   **Efficient development of complex agents:** The time required to develop intricate corporate agents is drastically compressed, from several months to just days or weeks (8x less time than other platforms). This efficiency gain represents a fourfold acceleration in deploying digital employees, greatly enhancing business agility.
*   **Scalable growth:** One of the most significant advantages of the Newo.ai platform is its scalability. As your business grows and your AI automation needs to become more sophisticated, there's no need to migrate to a different platform. Newo.ai supports the evolution from straightforward, no-code agents to a robust array of enterprise-grade AI solutions. More importantly, it does so while retaining all historical communication data and refined knowledge within the same ecosystem, ensuring continuity and deepening the value of your digital workforce over time.

The key value for businesses using Newo.ai digital employees is increased new revenue, repeat sales, customer satisfaction, and cost reduction. For example, a historical calculation for a real restaurant in Menlo Park, CA, USA:

*   Total calls handled by Newo.ai AI Hostess: 610/mo
*   Table bookings and large group reservations secured: $87,000
*   From business hour calls: $67,500
*   From off-hour calls: $19,500

In total, after implementing the Newo.ai AI Hostess, the restaurant earned an additional $33,400 per month or $401,000 per year.
