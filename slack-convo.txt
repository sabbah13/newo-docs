@Nikita Ziniuk @Aleksandr Pronin  I have a partner client needing to call a webhook to get data during a conversation.  Who can I talk to to learn more about the new attribute/feature for "Conversation - Tools [C] / project_attributes_settings_newo_tools" ?? Would love a training session on how to implement this new feature.

#### `project_attributes_settings_newo_tools`

**Title:** Conversation - Tools [C]

**Description:**

````md
This Attributes specifies the `Tools` that are available for the agent to use during the
conversation. You can either override existing tools or add new ones.

**Important:** This feature is under development, use with caution. Interface might be changed in
future releases. Do not use if it's not necessary.

Each tool has an `action` and `after_actions` (optionally)

**The following actions are supported:**

# Actions

## 1) `send_event`

Fire a named system event. **After actions:** _Not supported_ (this action cannot have
`after_actions`).

**Options**

- `type`: `"send_event"` (not required, `type` defaults to it)

> Use when you just need to notify the system and handle the event completely on your own.

---

## 2) `send_webhook`

Make an HTTP request to an external endpoint. **After actions:** _Supported_ (you may chain one or
more after actions below, in order).

**Options**

- `type`: `"send_webhook"` (required)
- `options.method`: HTTP method. One of `"GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "PATCH" | "DELETE"`. Default:
  `"GET"`.
- `options.url`: Target URL. **Required.**
- `options.query`: Fields to place in the URL query string. _(Object schema describing fields to
  fill.)_
- `options.headers`: HTTP headers to send. _(Object schema describing fields to fill.)_
- `options.body`: JSON body to send. _(Object schema describing fields to fill.)_

> Tip: Provide only the fields you actually need in `query`, `headers`, and `body`.

---

# After actions

## A) `send_urgent_message`

### Supported actions: [`send_webhook`]

Immediately sends a high-priority message to the user.

**Options**

- `prefix` _(string, optional)_: Text placed on a line above the message content.
- `uninterruptible` _(boolean, optional)_: If set, the message won't be interrupted by other flows.
  Default behavior is enabled.
- `call_analyze_conversation_skill` _(boolean, optional)_: Request follow-up analysis. Default:
  `false`.
- `call_manage_task_skill` _(boolean, optional)_: Request task handling. Default: `false`.

---

## B) `set_persona_attribute`

### Supported actions: [`send_webhook`]

Writes a value into the user's persona/profile.

**Options**

- `attribute_name` _(string, required)_: The profile field to set.
- `llm_process_instruction` _(string, optional)_: A short instruction telling the AI how to
  transform the latest input into the value to store (e.g., "If data is successfully collected,
  generate True, else False."). If empty, input used as-is with no post-pro.

---

## C) `set_prompt_section`

### Supported actions: [`send_webhook`]

Stores text into a named custom section of the user's prompt (for future turns).

**Options**

- `section_name` _(string, required)_: The prompt section to write to. Example: "section_name":
  "FullNameValidationProcess".
- `llm_process_instruction` _(string, optional)_: A short instruction telling the AI how to
  transform the latest input into the section value (e.g., "If validated, output the full name;
  otherwise output 'False'."). If empty, input used as-is with no post-pro.

---

# Notes

- **Conditions**: You decide when a tool triggers by defining booleans like `emailProvided`,
  `phoneNumberProvided`, etc.
- **useConversationHistory**: `true/false`—whether the tool can use prior conversation context to
  auto-fill fields. When `false`, only last agent's message considered.
- **Order of after actions** matters: they run top to bottom.

Example of overriding existing tool - `calculation_tool` and adding new `report_phone_number_tool`:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "report_phone_number_tool": {
      "conditions": {
        "phoneNumberProvided": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "description": "The user just provided their phone number"
        }
      },
      "action": {
        "type": "send_webhook",
        "options": {
          "method": "GET",
          "query": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "phone_number": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "User's provided phone number"
              }
            }
          },
          "headers": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "Content-Type": {
                "type": "string",
                "enum": ["application/json"]
              }
            }
          },
          "url": "https://hook.us1.make.com/somewebhookup"
        }
      },
      "after_actions": [
        {
          "type": "send_urgent_message"
        }
      ],
      "useConversationHistory": true
    },
    "calculation_tool": {
      "description": "The agent calculates the price and informs the user about it.",
      "conditions": {
        "agentPromised": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "description": "The agent promised to calculate the approximate estimate price right now exactly in their last message (enclosed in <LatestConvoAgentAnswer>)."
        }
      },
      "useConversationHistory": false
    }
  }
}
```

Example of adding new tool - `custom_tool`:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "custom_tool": {
      "conditions": {
        "userAskedForCustomTool": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "description": "The agent promised to use a custom tool in their last message (enclosed in <LatestConvoAgentAnswer>) and use previously provided data in the conversation (enclosed in <Conversation>)."
        }
      },
      "useConversationHistory": true
    }
  }
}
```

You can add any amount of tools. For example, you can override `calculation_tool` and add
`custom_tool` at the same time:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "calculation_tool": {
      "description": "The agent calculates the price and informs the user about it.",
      "conditions": {
        "agentPromised": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "description": "The agent promised to calculate the approximate estimate price right now exactly in their last message (enclosed in <LatestConvoAgentAnswer>)."
        }
      },
      "useConversationHistory": false
    },
    "custom_tool": {
      "conditions": {
        "userAskedForCustomTool": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "description": "The agent promised to use a custom tool in their last message (enclosed in <LatestConvoAgentAnswer>) and use previously provided data in the conversation (enclosed in <Conversation>)."
        }
      },
      "useConversationHistory": true
    }
  }
}
```

@Dmitry Filin, this description still is not obvious enough. We need to document it better and ask @Ryan to include the article in our help center.

I don't agree, we don't teach people about webhook and http/ interface
Please address precisely what is unclear

@Dmitry Filin If the tool calls a webhook and it returns some data in a JSON format, how can we configure the agent to use that data in the ongoing conversation?

There are few different concepts you can invoke here to achieve such result:
Instruction -> send_urgent_message.
 More robust, less flexible
In instruction, the agent says: Let me According to instructions, agent says something like: 'let me do something, ill get back to you with the information'
Tool trigger fires, receiving a response
using prefix after_action property you tell agent how to process the reponse
agent speaks the information loud to print it in the conversation
you continue with the information in the history
2. Instruction -> set_custom_prompt_section
 Relied mostly on v2v interpretation, way more flexible
According to instructions, agent says some trigger phrase
Tool trigger fires, receiving a response
using llm_process_instruction after_action property you format the information in the needed way
it writes to the custom_prompt_section and eventually becomes available in the agent context
In instruction, you refer to the introduced prompt section

@Pavel @Alex Efremov @Ryan I believe we have a huge opportunity to help with adaptive and expedited 3rd party integrations using this really cool feature that @Dmitry Filin has built.  But the documentation is lacking, although I understand there are some details on the platform as pointed out by Dmitry, but I share the same questions from Abhi, Nikita and others with regards to how exactly we can utilize this new capability.   What would be very helpful, is a single document that demonstrates many use cases starting with scenario setup/code-phrase, etc....  then the webhoook setup for each after action example provided and how to handle the response within a scenario.
The added information provided above is helpful, but still incomplete for someone like myself to adapt and deploy.
It would be great to see full complete use cases and examples for each of those concepts.
How exactly does one continue with the information in the history after a send_urgent_message is executed?
How exactly should the llm process instructions to best work with LLM in a recommended format?  Example of an instruction to format data best suitable for LLM would be helpful.
According to what instructions will the agent say some trigger phrase when using a set_custom_prompt_section?
An example of how to use the response data that is added to a custom_prompt_section, when it becomes "eventually" available to the agent context again would be very useful.
Where and how in the instruction would you refer to the introduced prompt section?
How does using urgent message differ from adding to set custom prompt section in different use cases?
A complete help document built similiar to how we've provided help documents for outbound, CRM and other integrations would be VERY VALUABLE for the entire newo support team.
Bottomline, we aren't as skilled to know how to utilize this feature without more documentation, examples, and definitions of the various parts to this.  I'm not alone here.  If this were made available, I know this would enable many more integrations to occur with our Level B/C partners and could alleviate many more requests going to Alex Pronin for custom integration support.
@Dmitry Filin Fantastic job thus far building this capability!  This has enormous potential for everyone!  Thank you for your hard work and support.
